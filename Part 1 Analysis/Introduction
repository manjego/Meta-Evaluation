Part 1 Analysis is performed to carry out the meta-evaluation of automated evaluation metrics 
ROUGE and BERTScore used in the text summarization. I have created the abstractive and extractive 
text summarization systems to generate the 100 news articles containing protest events. And evaluated the generated 
summaries using automated evaluation metrics ROUGE and BERTScore.
