The interview | South China Morning Post
Hariprasad Chaurasia is one of India's most acclaimed musicians and is often credited with introducing Indian classical music to Western ears. He plays the north Indian bamboo flute, an unpromising piece of low-tech equipment, from which he manages to coax sounds of such a heavenly nature that audiences are transported into extraordinary raptures. In 1986, he played for 28 hours at a festival in Paris because his fans refused to let him leave. If you wish to experience this phenomenon for yourself, he is appearing in Hong Kong this Friday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre as part of a cultural and trade event called India Into The New Millennium.
Chaurasia lives in what is now known as Mumbai (formerly Bombay), and as I happened to be visiting that city over Lunar New Year, I decided to pay him a visit. Early one recent morning, therefore, I headed for the city's northern suburbs in a taxi. I was hoping that the driver might provide some analysis of the famous musician's art but, alas, it turned out that he'd never heard of Chaurasia. He observed my backseat imitation of a flautist for a while, then queried, doubtfully, 'Music wallah?'  The 'music wallah' was eating almonds and papaya when I arrived. He is 61, twinkly, courteous and more apparently at ease with himself than most people I've met in a professional capacity. He seemed happy to have a stranger sitting in his front room and he chatted with great amiability; being interviewed was evidently something he slotted seamlessly into his existence, between telephone calls, trips upstairs to talk to unseen relatives and servants, and food.
I liked this attitude. For me, it was a restful way to start the day: drinking masala tea, listening to the evocative Indian sounds of sweeping and birds through the balcony door, and watching the master pad around in his bare feet, sharing contented observations about his life. Occasionally, he peered into my notebook and cried, 'What handwriting! So powerful!' Later, when I was bitten by mosquitoes, he produced a brown bottle of liquid as a

",5,"PUBLISHED : Sunday, 20 February, 2000, 12:00am The interview | South China Morning Post Hariprasad Chaurasia is one of India's most acclaimed musicians and is often credited with introducing Indian classical music to Western ears.He plays the north Indian bamboo flute, an unpromising piece of low-tech equipment, from which he manages to coax sounds of such a heavenly nature that audiences are transported into extraordinary raptures.In 1986, he played for 28 hours at a festival in Paris because his fans refused to let him leave.If you wish to experience this phenomenon for yourself, he is appearing in Hong Kong this Friday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre as part of a cultural and trade event called India Into The New Millennium.Chaurasia lives in what is now known as Mumbai (formerly Bombay), and as I happened to be visiting that city over Lunar New Year, I decided to pay him a visit.

1,"PREFERRED By KEVIN FREKING It's not easy figuring out exactly what U.S. voters want when it comes to health care. A Gallup poll released early this fall offered a dozen separate ways  to expand health insurance coverage. Each suggestion garnered majority support, including tax breaks for small businesses, 94 percent; requiring large companies to offer health coverage or pay into a pool, 81 percent; and federal subsidies for the poor, 76 percent. The implication was clear: The public wants change. But two weeks ago, Gallup released another poll. That poll showed most Americans are satisfied with their health coverage and with how much they pay for health care. So what gives? The polls demonstrate the long-standing conflict that has dogged every proposed overhaul of the health care system dating back to Harry Truman, president until 1953. Americans support the principle of extending coverage to millions of  people, but only so long as they are not negatively affected by the potential trade-offs, namely higher costs or reduced access. And that's the dilemma for the presidential candidates. Expanding health insurance to the 47 million uninsured is projected to cost more than {dollar}100 billion (?69 billion) annually. The candidates have to find a way to pay for that expense. But it could be a political death knell to suggest that the average voter pay for it. Democratic presidential candidates have found one way to finesse it. Former Senator John Edwards would raise taxes for those households with incomes exceeding {dollar}200,000 (?136,000) a year. Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama would raise taxes for households with incomes exceeding {dollar}250,000 (?170,000) a year. The median household income in the United States is {dollar}48,200 (?33,000), so the vast majority of voters would be spared. ""If you're in politics you can't go {dollar}1 (68 euro cents) below {dollar}200,000 (?136,000) on the income tax or you really start losing people,"" said Robert Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard University. The Democratic candidates don't just ask the wealthy to pay for expanding coverage. They also calculate that widespread adoption of electronic health records will help pay for it. For example, they cite a study by the RAND Corporation, a think tank, claiming that electronic  health records could save {dollar}77 billion (?52 billion) a year. But many health analysts don't buy it. ""The Republicans are going to save money that way. The Democrats are  going to save money that way. But I don't see any evidence from the literature that's going to happen,"" said Michael Tanner, director of health and welfare studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. If those savings don't occur, the candidates will have to find other  sources of revenue for their proposals, Tanner said. Both Clinton and Obama have called for employers to pay for some of their workers' health insurance, or pay a certain percentage of the company's payroll into a fund. But nowhere do they spell out that percentage. That's an important omission. The additional costs could force some employers to lay off workers, which won't sit well with voters. Edwards  said the rate paid into the pool would be 6 percent of payroll. Meanwhile, the Republican candidates generally rely on tax breaks to  make insurance more affordable. All of the Republican candidates reject  the idea of employer and individual mandates - even Mitt Romney, who was governor of Massachusetts when that state approved a health plan requiring people to buy health insurance. Republican Senator John McCain calls for an individual refundable tax credit of {dollar}2,500 (?1,700) for individuals and {dollar}5,000 (?3,400) for families with insurance coverage. With a tax credit, the amount of taxes owed is reduced by {dollar}1 (68 euro cents) for every {dollar}1 in credits. Rudy Giuliani proposes an income tax deduction of up to {dollar}7,500 (?5,100) for individuals and {dollar}15,000 (?10,200) for families who purchase insurance in the individual m

{dollar}5,000 (?3,400) for families with insurance coverage.With a tax credit, the amount of taxes owed is reduced by {dollar}1 (68 euro cents) for every {dollar}1 in credits.

2,"One week ago a letter, lengthy but beautifully written, was posted online calling for the Chinese government to end its long-standing secrecy over the Tiananmen Square massacre. In one part it boldly proclaimed: “The butcher must stand trial.” It was signed by 11 Chinese students, mainly living in the US with one from Britain. The eleventh and final name belonged to Wu Lebao, a 31-year-old Chinese refugee living in Melbourne. Wu describes the bloodshed of 4 June 1989, when the Chinese government opened fire on hundreds of students who had been calling for democracy, as the day authorities “want people to forget”. When he was a student in China his history textbook dedicated just one sentence to the incident, trivialising it as “political turmoil”. “That was the closest we came to achieving democracy,” says Wu. “Many people died and lots of people lost their family, friends and classmates.” The letter’s public critique of the government is unusual, more so because it comes from a new generation of Chinese students who are too young to remember the massacre first-hand and have grown up in a ruthless media blackout, with government censors actively scrubbing the Chinese internet clean of any frank discussion about that fateful week in 1989. A fraction of China’s 600 million internet users, including Wu, use a VPN to “jump the firewall” and access censored content and global perspectives on blocked sites like Twitter. The letter triggered an angry editorial by China’s nationalist paper The Global Times, which accused the authors of trying to “tear society apart”, adding: “When China is moving forward, some are trying to drag up history in an attempt to tear apart society.” The lead signatory to the letter, Gu Yi, called the paper’s response “the best advertisement” the letter could have ever received. Last week the Chinese president Xi Jinping rallied overseas students to “serve the country” and become a “united front” – a term Wu says was “first applied by Chairman Mao”. “Even

online calling for the Chinese government to end its long-standing secrecy over the Tiananmen Square massacre.In one part it boldly proclaimed: “The butcher must stand trial.” It was signed by 11 Chinese students, mainly living in the US with one from Britain.The eleventh and final name belonged to Wu Lebao, a 31-year-old Chinese refugee living in Melbourne.When he was a student in China his history textbook dedicated just one sentence to the incident, trivialising it as “political turmoil”.“Many people died and lots of people lost their family, friends and classmates.” The letter’s public critique of the government is unusual, more so because it comes from a new generation of Chinese students who are too young to remember the massacre first-hand and have grown up in a ruthless media blackout, with government censors actively scrubbing the Chinese internet clean of any frank discussion about that fateful week in 1989.

",5,"One week ago a letter, lengthy but beautifully written, was posted online calling for the Chinese government to end its long-standing secrecy over the Tiananmen Square massacre.In one part it boldly proclaimed: “The butcher must stand trial.” It was signed by 11 Chinese students, mainly living in the US with one from Britain.The eleventh and final name belonged to Wu Lebao, a 31-year-old Chinese refugee living in Melbourne.When he was a student in China his history textbook dedicated just one sentence to the incident, trivialising it as “political turmoil”.“Many people died and lots of people lost their family, friends and classmates.” The letter’s public critique of the government is unusual, more so because it comes from a new generation of Chinese students who are too young to remember the massacre first-hand and have grown up in a ruthless media blackout, with government censors actively scrubbing the Chinese internet clean of any frank discussion about that fateful week in 1989.

3,"China: ‘A soaring demand for quality medical care’ In Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass, Alice finds herself facing a difficult conundrum. She’s running towards a distant hill; yet no matter how quickly she runs, her surroundings move with her, effectively stranding her. She meets the enigmatic Red Queen. “Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place,” the Queen explains. “If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!” China’s healthcare system suffers from the same problem – despite running at full speed over the past few decades, it can’t possibly move fast enough to keep up with the country’s social and economic changes. China’s per capita GDP grew more than 25-fold from 1980 to 2011; its life expectancy rose by nine years; its infant mortality rate quartered. Yet as Chinese citizens grow older and wealthier, they are also burdened by a rise in pollution, smoking, obesity and other public-health hazards, creating a soaring demand for quality medical care. During the Mao era, in the 1940s through to the mid-70s, the country’s healthcare system was rudimentary but egalitarian, entirely supported by the state. Yet in the 80s, reformer Deng Xiaoping dismantled the system, leaving hospitals suddenly responsible for their own economic wellbeing. The result has been rampant profit-seeking: overprescription of medications, excessive testing and shocking efforts to cut corners. Many Chinese hospitals don’t keep soap in their public bathrooms. Physicians are so underpaid that they often must supplement their salaries with kickbacks from drug companies and patient bribes. The system is also deeply stratified. A typical villager, upon falling ill, will first visit a local clinic – usually a concrete-floored, one- to two-room facility, equipped with little more than intravenous drips and a small pharmacy. If his malady requires further attention, he will be forced to ascend through a hierarchy of institutions – to a county hospital, then a provincial hospital, then a specialised clinic in a metropolis such as Beijing or Shanghai. Major institutions, inundated with patients from afar, suffer from chronic overcrowding. It is common to see families sleeping overnight on hospital lawns to avoid early-morning queues. With the stakes so high, tempers run hot when treatments fail. Patient-on-doctor violence has become startlingly common – stabbings and mob-style attacks have risen 23% a year on average since 2002, according to the China Hospital Management Association. A typical hospital suffers one such incident every two weeks. The Chinese government has poured billions of pounds into healthcare reform in recent years, and the system has improved accordingly. At present, 99% of the rural population gets some kind of insurance, up from 21% a decade ago; the country plans to roll out universal coverage by 2020. Yet the price of basic medical services has also risen, and many insured patients are paying as much as they once were. As of last year, the government gives each rural resident 280 yuan (£28.34) in annual healthcare subsidies. Yet elaborate procedures can cost many times that, and patients must pay the difference out of pocket. China has one of the highest savings rates in the world – about 50% – largely because families fear catastrophic healthcare costs. Chinese authorities have been embracing other, more innovative ideas to improve the system: new technologies, private investment, new training regimens for doctors – in short, redoubling their speed just to keep up the pace. Jonathan Kaiman South Africa: ‘Labouring under a two-tier system’ With the world’s biggest HIV caseload, rampant tuberculosis (TB) and rising obesity, South African healthcare is under unique strain. The government spent more than 8.5% of GDP on healthcare in 2012, higher than the 5% recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for a country of its socioeconomic status, yet performed worse than comparable nations. The historical legacy of colonialism and apartheid is still manifest in one of the most unequal societies in the world. Healthcare is no exception and South Africa continues to labour under a two-tier system. The private sector consumes 60% of total health spending yet caters to only about 15% of the population. The facilities are world class and less expensive than in Britain, the US or Australia – fertility treatment, for example, attracts foreigners at a fraction of the cost – but are beyond the financial means of most South Africans. Public healthcare struggles to meet the needs of the other 85%, with often overcrowded facilities, poor equipment and shortages of drugs. Less than 30% of doctors, dentists, pharmacists, physiotherapists and psychologists, and just 40% of professional nurses, work in the public sector. Some essential services are provided free by the state. TB treatment, for example, is not available in private clinics. After diagnosing a patient with TB, private doctors refer the patient to the public sector, where everyone receives TB medicine free of charge. The most striking success in free provision is the antiretroviral treatment programme for people with HIV, initiated 10 years ago after the government, accused of “Aids denialism”, lost a landmark court case. Today, South Africa has the world’s biggest public-sector HIV programme, with 2.5 million people receiving treatment. The country’s life expectancy has consequently increased from 53 in 2002 to 60 in 2013. But there are practical barriers. Patients’ first point of contact are primary healthcare clinics where, in serious cases, nurses and community health workers can refer them to hospital. These clinics are concentrated in cities and towns, often inaccessible to people in rural areas who cannot afford transport. Some 47% of children live in rural areas where only 12% of doctors and 19% of nurses work, according to the People’s Health Movement of South Africa. Some villagers rely on an informal network of traditional healers and medicines. Not everything in public hospitals is free, and only an estimated 17% of South Africans are part of a medical aid scheme to cover the costs. In addition, staff shortages translate into long waiting times. Critics say treatable conditions are not treated on time and preventable diseases are not prevented. The government has admitted the need for a “radical improvement” in the quality of services and “massive investment” in buildings and equipment, as well as fundamental changes in management. The health minister, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, has been known to roll up his sleeves and work a night shift at the Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital in Soweto, the biggest hospital in the southern hemisphere. He and his family use public hospitals and in 2011 he told the Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper: “It’s a self-defeating prophecy to keep on saying we don’t have the means. There are good services in countries with fewer facilities and staff than us.” Nevertheless, Motsoaledi has a big plan for healthcare reform: a national health insurance scheme. The aim is to provide essential healthcare for all, irrespective of employment status and ability to pay, as enshrined in the post-apartheid constitution. Anyone earning above a certain income will be required to contribute to the NHI Fund. The plan has met resistance from the private sector. But the government insists: “It will actually make the sector more sustainable by making it levy reasonable fees. The intention of NHI is rather to make sure that citizens are able to use both the public and private sectors in such a way that they complement each other rather than one undermining the other. At the moment, private healthcare is only for the rich. NHI is trying to blend the two in a more sustainable manner that benefits the population.” David Smith India: ‘Public or private, India’s health care system is largely unregulated’ When Ria, 12, an illiterate maid’s daughter, suddenly developed a giant lump in her abdomen, her mother knew better than to trust India’s publicly run hospital system. Mazes of dingy corridors, outdated equipment and filthy wards where linens are absent and rats run freely greet the desperately poor and sick patients seeking care. India spends just 1.3% of GDP on healthcare, one of the lowest rates in the world. Every day, patients from around the country, some who have travelled for days, can be seen queueing outside India’s biggest public teaching hospital, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi. Hundreds jostle to see erratically available specialists. Others push their way to the counters of crowded roadside medical shops to purchase not just bandages and surgical equipment, but even life-saving drugs and the pints of blood patients are often expected to provide.

4,"The Sinification of a Vegas casino mogul; Wynn some, lose some, life's a great big gamble
PUBLISHED : Wednesday, 21 April, 2010, 12:00am
Some of Steve Wynn's earliest advice on how to succeed in China came from former United States president George H. W. Bush.
It was back in 2002 and the billionaire casino developer had recently made a successful bid for one of three new gaming licences in Macau. Bush senior and his wife Barbara, whose son was then the  incumbent US president, were  friends of the Wynns and had come to stay at their golf course residence outside  Las Vegas.
'George sat me down and he said: 'Okay Steve, I'm going to explain it to you and I know some of this may be counter-intuitive',' Wynn recalled  in an interview.
This is what he told Wynn: 'Americans pay a lot of attention to contracts and papers, because if you mean what you say and you say what you mean you will sign your name to it ... that's the way we think here, it's a European tradition.' So said Bush, who moved to Beijing in the early 1970s as America's first envoy to China following the communists' rise to power.
'In China, the tradition is relationship-driven. What people say to one another matters a great deal. And the Chinese people are very organised and methodical in their approach. They love planning, they love thinking things out and having a programme ... So the art form in China, Steve, is to know what  the plan is and how  you fit into it.
'And another thing: that programme changes from time to time,' Bush said.
So began the Sinification of Stephen Alan Wynn.
In the eight years since that first lesson, the 68-year-old has started learning Mandarin, listed his Macau business on the Hong Kong stock market and invested US$1.8 billion building two casino hotels in Macau (the second one opens this week). Last year, Macau accounted for 60 per cent of revenue and 67 per cent of core earnings at his Nasdaq-listed Wynn Resorts.
Learning how to fit into the Chinese plan has paid off in spades. Since opening in September 2006, the US$1.2 billion Wynn Macau has generated US$1.4 billion in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) on US$5.4 billion in sales. Wynn also scooped up US$900 million selling a 'subconcession', or casino licence, in Macau.
And the stock market listing raised another HK$14.49 billion.
'Macau has been very good to me,' says Wynn. 'And we're trying to figure out more ways to be good to Macau.'
As many foreign investors in  China have discovered, surprises abound. A year after the original three casino licences were awarded Macau then created a fourth, a 'subconcession' for Las Vegas Sands, which had fallen out with original partner Galaxy Entertainment.
Wynn says his contract with the government stipulated that an increase in the number of licences would be matched by a proportionate tax reduction, which stood (and still stands) at a hefty 39 per cent of casino revenue.
'[Macau chief executive Edmund Ho Hau-wah] says to me: 'Steve, I need your co-operation in this matter. I can't be lowering taxes when none of the new casinos are even open',' Wynn recalled. 'I said to Edmund: 'Anything that is good for Macau is good for Wynn'.
'I shut up and I didn't care what the goddamn contract said because this was about a relationship,' Wynn says, citing his lesson from Bush. 'I can say I have a contract and I'm a publicly-listed company and so on ... but I'm in China and that doesn't mean poop.'
Few people have been more intertwined with Las Vegas' modern history than Wynn. The son of an east coast bingo parlour operator, he went to Sin City in the late 1960s and ran a liquor distribution business before buying a minority stake in the Frontier casino. He acquired his first piece of land on the Las Vegas Strip in 1971 from Howard Hughes. He not only shook Frank Sinatra's hand but had him star in commercials for his casino hotels.
After running the downtown Golden Nugget casino for years, Wynn opened the Strip's first modern mega-resort, the Mirage, in 1989, financing it with junk bonds issued by Michael Milken. In the 1990s, his Mirage Resorts cemented Wynn's reputation for innovation by building the themed Treasure Island resort and the upscale Bellagio hotel.

5,"‘There were more dogs than people’ Naoki Ishikawa I took this one Christmas 15 years ago, in the port town of Ilulissat in Greenland. It was some time between 11am and 2pm, during the few hours they had of daylight. Winter out there is essentially one long night. There were more dogs than people in Ilulissat. They’re kept outside, even in winter. I saw them everywhere, eating fish or pulling sleds. I met a musher who said I could join him on a hunt. I asked him why he didn’t use a snowmobile. If a snowmobile breaks down, he said, that’s it – whereas dogs just keep on going. A sled is not comfortable. It’s wooden boards sliding on bumpy snow. I had to hold on tight while trying to take photographs so as not to get blown away. The dogs were so excited, so unpredictable. I liked seeing how they moved, seeing their personalities emerge. I couldn’t make them pose and, to me, that’s what’s so intriguing about photography: capturing the unexpected. At one point, one of the dogs got its leg tangled in the reins. The musher ran to help and, though they couldn’t communicate with words, I could see their strong bond. I felt that love. ‘Animal heads haunted my childhood’ Clare Benson A lot of people think the animal I’m carrying here was freshly killed. Actually, it’s a stuffed kudu my father shot on a hunt in Africa. I took the picture on his driveway in north Michigan, where I grew up. My father is a big hunter. In the 1960s, he was a guide in Alaska: there are lots of shots of him carrying the heads of animals on his back. They haunted my sisters and I growing up. I wanted to recreate them, using the biggest animal on his wall. I tied the kudu head to an old military backpack with bear hide wrapped around it. It was really beautiful and exotic. To see it in that cold landscape was even more absurd than taking any of the other dead animals back into nature. When I put it on my back, I couldn’t see the way the horns come over my head, or how the head curves and aligns with my body, so it was strange and beautiful to see it later. At first, I laughed, but it’s sad too. Hunting is part of the culture here. Everyone gets the first day of hunting season off school. So I’m interested in the relationship the population has with death. As a child, I helped with prepping and skinning although I never actually killed any animals. I grew up eating a lot of the meat my father would hunt locally: bear, caribou, whatever he brought back. I think there’s something valuable in that. Hunting as a tradition has been twisted, though. I don’t agree with it when it’s not for survival or sustenance – and I’m not fond of those mounted heads. There’s something absurd in this fascination with representing death and the power of humans to conquer nature. ‘You don’t leave town without a gun’ Julia de Cooker Svalbard is a Norwegian archipelago to the north-east of Greenland, the last inhabited place before the North Pole. It has no indigenous population. People from across the world come to visit and live there because you don’t need a visa. If you can find a job, you can stay. There are 45 different nationalities in a population of about 2,300. Of course, lots of people go there to experience Arctic life but, given the taxes are very low, plenty of them are there for the financial benefits. The towns are only 100 years old. It’s very modern, very new. There are no traditions, things are built from scratch, and this modernity jars with the landscape – it’s uncanny. Being there, you realise the extent to which nature reigns over life. It really is hostile. You become very small and it’s a beautiful feeling. The limo belonged to a Danish miner, who never really explained why he bought it. In the town there are some roads, but there are too many cars for the number of people living there. At the end of October, there’s a blues festival to mark the beginning of the polar night, and the guy had loaned his limo to a visiting band, which is how I came to see it. Usually it’s hidden under snow. The people there live in comfort. You’d think you were in a ski resort in the Alps, although some things remind you that you’re not. You never leave town without a gun – because of the bears. And there isn’t a single tree. ‘I became obsessed with skating tights’ Wendy McMurdo In the mid 2000s, there was a craze for Nintendo sports games, especially skating. I wanted to explore the relationship children had with digital gaming and ended up at Dundee Ice Arena. I wanted to photograph young figure skaters training. Philippa Pickard, in the photograph, was 18 at the time. By some weird coincidence, the skaters who trained there had actually been models for the Nintendo avatars. I was shooting early in the morning. Although I set up my equipment on the ice, I wasn’t on skates. I had lights and all sorts of electrical cords. The whole thing was slightly scary, but as soon as I looked through the camera, all that melted away. What I saw was incredible, these amazing bodies. I would just watch and occasionally ask them to do a move again. I wanted to produce something like those avatars, like a still from a game. Skating is all about illusion, much more so than ballet. If you look at female skaters, their tights are stretched down over their boot to extend the line of the leg. I became obsessed with this. I got so close, I could see all the ladders and rips. Indeterminate Objects by Wendy McMurdo is on at the Photographer’s Gallery, London, until January 2018. ‘I wandered through an empty New York’ Michele Palazzo When Storm Jonas hit New York in early 2016, the city shut down. Roads, subways and shops all closed. Everyone stayed indoors but I couldn’t wait to get out. It was a Saturday and I was so excited I woke up at 6am and grabbed my camera. I’m a street photographer. But that morning, nobody was around. Walking through the heart of the city with no cars, no subway and no pedestrians was weird – New York is never empty. I wandered down to the Flatiron Building. I pass it every day and have seen it in every kind of weather. I’m friends with the doorman, who has shown me around and let me in on its secrets. Normally photographers attempt to capture the whole building. But because it’s about 20 storeys tall, you either have to stand really far away or tilt your lens upwards, which distorts the image. Instead, I focused on the lower level. The wind was unbelievable. I posted it on social media and it went viral. It completely changed my career. There are so many photos of the Flatiron, it’s hard to be original. What’s special about this shot is that it looks like it’s suspended in time. It’s not clear if it was taken today, or in the past, or even if it’s a photo at all. ‘The ice buildings can be

6,"We’re wrapping up our live coverage now with a summary of key points. Thanks for reading. Our latest news take is here. China has placed surface-to-air missile equipment on Woody Island, part of the disputed Paracel Islands in the South China Sea, according to reports confirmed by the US and Taiwan governments. The region is subject to claims by a number of surrounding nations. China has been extending coastlines and building on top of reefs to strengthen their claim over large swathes of the region, which sees about $5trillion in international trade pass through it annually. Initial reports by Fox News were based on satellite images indicating construction in the last week. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi did not dispute the reports, but said China was entitled under international law to build the “limited and necessary self defence facilities”. Minister Wang however suggested reports were the “creation” of Western media. Taipei said its military was “closely monitoring further development of the situation”. A spokesperson for the US state department said the US “continues to call on all claimants to halt land reclamation, construction, and militarization of features in the South China Sea.” After a US naval Destroyer sailed close to Paracel island last month, China accused the US of being “the biggest cause of militarisation in the South China Sea.” Australia’s foreign minister had earlier flagged raising the dispute with Wang Yi in their annual strategic meeting today, earning a rebuke from the China foreign ministry. Admiral Harry Harris, commander of the US Pacific Command, said a move to install missiles would be a “clear indication of militarisation.” Following the conclusion of the Asean summit in California this week, US president Barack Obama said leaders had discussed “the need for tangible steps in the South China Sea to lower tensions including a halt to further reclamation, new construction and militarisation of disputed areas”. From Reuters: The deployment of missiles on the Paracel islands in the South China Sea would be contrary to China’s pledge not to militarise the region, Admiral Harry Harris, commander of the US Pacific Command, has said. Harris said such a move would represent “a militarisation of the South China Sea in ways that President Xi said he [would] not do.” “It would be a clear indication of militarisation,” Harris told a briefing in Tokyo, where he is meeting with Japanese defence officials. Al Jazeera has filmed a one-minute explainer of the South China Sea dispute. Meanwhile in Vietnam, this report from AP. More than 100 people have gathered in Hanoi to commemorate the anniversary of Vietnam’s brief but bloody border war with China. Thirty seven years ago, 600,000 Chinese troops invaded Vietnam to “teach Vietnam a lesson” for ousting the Beijing-backed Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. China withdrew its troops after a month. The residents lit incense Wednesday and laid flowers at the statue of King Ly Thai To, a Vietnamese hero, in a ceremony that lasted an hour. They chanted “down with the aggressors,” and “Hoang Sa, Truong Sa,” the Vietnamese terms for the Paracel and Spratly islands, which are claimed by both countries. The commemoration took place even though large gatherings without government sanctions are often stopped by the police. There have been no official government commemorations of the war. The press conference with the Chinese and Australian foreign ministers has concluded now. The conference was already scheduled to follow a meeting between the two ministers. That it occurred within hours of the missile reports was just good or bad timing, depending on your perspective, and most questions went immediately to the international incident. Minister Wang Yi did not deny reports that Beijing has installed surface-to-air missiles on Woody Island in the disputed region of the South China Sea, but he did suggest the stories were the creation of “Western media”. He said it was well within China’s rights of self preservation under international law to install “limited and necessary self defence facilities” on islands and reefs where Chinese personnel are stationed. He pointed to non-military installations by China, including lighthouses and rescue facilities which were contributing to the “public good” of the international community. The foreign ministers have spoken on the Philippines arbitration hearing. Bishop said the Philippines was simply seeking a clarification of international law, “not a determination on the merits of respective maritime claims” she said. Wang countered that China was following the law by not accepting arbitration with the Philippines because China had issued a declaration excluding it from compulsory settlement measures in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. “Let me also point out China is not the only country to issue such declarations” Wang said, citing “30 to 40” other countries, including Australia. He said the Philippines pursuit was illegitimate, and the arbitration sought was not consistent with international practice because it did not ask for china’s consent or consult with them, he said. He questioned if there was a hidden political agenda. Australian minister Bishop welcomed Wang’s statement that China did not intend to militarise the islands. She said the pair had “a forthright and candid discussion” about recent events in the South China Sea, and that their public and private position is consistent. “We do not take sides on

defence facilities”.A spokesperson for the US state department said the US “continues to call on all claimants to halt land reclamation, construction, and militarization of features in the South China Sea.” After a US naval Destroyer sailed close to Paracel island last month, China accused the US of being “the biggest cause of militarisation in the South China Sea.” Australia’s foreign minister had earlier flagged raising the dispute with Wang Yi in their annual strategic meeting today, earning a rebuke from the China foreign ministry.From Reuters: The deployment of missiles on the Paracel islands in the South China Sea would be contrary to China’s pledge not to militarise the region, Admiral Harry Harris, commander of the US Pacific Command, has said.He said it was well within China’s rights of self preservation under international law to install “limited and necessary self defence facilities” on islands and reefs where Chinese personnel are stationed.He said the Philippines pursuit was illegitimate, and the arbitration sought was not consistent with international practice because it did not ask for china’s consent or consult with them, he said.

",5,"Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi did not dispute the reports, but said China was entitled under international law to build the “limited and necessary self defence facilities”.A spokesperson for the US state department said the US “continues to call on all claimants to halt land reclamation, construction, and militarization of features in the South China Sea.” After a US naval Destroyer sailed close to Paracel island last month, China accused the US of being “the biggest cause of militarisation in the South China Sea.” Australia’s foreign minister had earlier flagged raising the dispute with Wang Yi in their annual strategic meeting today, earning a rebuke from the China foreign ministry.From Reuters: The deployment of missiles on the Paracel islands in the South China Sea would be contrary to China’s pledge not to militarise the region, Admiral Harry Harris, commander of the US Pacific Command, has said.He said it was well within China’s rights of self preservation under international law to install “limited and necessary self defence facilities” on islands and reefs where Chinese personnel are stationed.He said the Philippines pursuit was illegitimate, and the arbitration sought was not consistent with international practice because it did not ask for china’s consent or consult with them, he said.

7,"Roundup: Greek PM urges refugees to choose relocation process over risky illegal crossings into FYROM Maria Spiliopoulou, Sofia Papadopoulou By Maria Spiliopoulou, Sofia Papadopoulou ATHENS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Tuesday urged refugees and migrants stranded in Greece to choose the safe legal relocation program in hospitality centers across the country rather than the illegal risky river crossings into neighboring Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). On Monday, about 1,000 people, including children, left the muddy, overcrowded makeshift camp at the border crossing of Idomeni and entered FYROM through an unfenced and unguarded dangerous stream five km further. Referring to Monday's incident, Tsipras made a fresh appeal to the more than 12,000 people who have remained in Idomeni for weeks after the gradual borders closures along the Balkan route to central Europe. He advised them to agree to be transferred to hosting facilities in order to receive adequate aid from the Greek state before their relocation to other European countries under an EU program launched last year. However, most of the refugees insist on staying close to the border in the hope that it may reopen soon. Many believe that EU leaders gathering in Brussels on March 17 to 18 may reach a decision for the overnight lifting of restrictions, refugees at the Idomeni tent city told Xinhua on Tuesday. Others have started to realize that the borders will most likely remain closed and are considering the relocation option. ""Interest in the relocation program is certainly picking up as people come to realize that this might be a good solution for them,"" Babar Baloch, the UNHCR head in Idomeni told Xinhua on Tuesday. ""The borders will not open again soon,"" the Greek leader underlined on Tuesday, suggesting refugees ignore the rumors and ""criminals"" misinforming and encouraging them to risk their lives to cross rivers illegally to enter FYROM only to be sent back to Greece. Tsipras pointed to leaflets distributed at Idomeni during the weekend urging refugees to cross into FYROM from a swelling stream near Chamilo village. Greek police are conducting an investigation to trace the individuals or group responsible for the pamphlet. According to police sources, Greek authorities suspect smugglers or ""irresponsible people who pose as volunteers."" Some 40 volunteers along with 30 photo journalists were detained by FYROM authorities on Monday after crossing the stream alongside the refugees. While most of them have been released after paying a 260-euro (289 U.S. dollar) fine, according to the Greek side. However, it was still unclear on Tuesday afternoon where the refugees who crossed into FYROM ended up. Greek state officials have not confirmed media reports that hundreds of refugees have been sent back to Greece by FYROM authorities informally through similar unfenced border crossings over the past few hours. Athens is still waiting for Skopje to submit a formal request for the return of the refugees Yorgos Kyritsis, the spokesman of Greece's Refugees Crisis Management Mechanism body told Greek MEGA television channel on Tuesday. ""We cannot confirm nor deny whether they have been returned,"" deputy defense minister Dimitris Vitsas told local SKAI radio. During a visit to Idomeni on Tuesday, European Commissioner for migration, home affairs and citizenship, Dimitris Avramopoulos, reaffirmed ""EU's solidarity and support to Greece in coping with the refugee crisis and the resulting humanitarian crisis."" The unacceptable living conditions at Idomeni where refugees sleep in rain-soaked tents, relying on aid provided by NGOs for food and medical care must stop, he said. Avramopoulos called on EU member states to honor their commitments regarding the relocation of some 65,000 refugees across the EU over the next two years with no further delay. So far, less than 1,000 have been relocated, according to official data.

8,"Zimbabwe's elections could mark an end to the power-sharing government that
emerged after bloodshed at the polls in 2008 and was seen as untenable from the 
outset.
Morgan Tsvangirai, the prime minister and Movement for Democratic Change
(MDC) leader, is making his third attempt to unseat the long-time president,
Robert Mugabe, who heads the Zanu-PF party.
The two are among five presidential candidates.
Some 6.4 million people are registered to cast their ballots for a new
parliament and president at 9670 polling stations across the Southern African
country.
Mugabe drew international condemnation and sanctions from the West over the
violence and intimidation of the last presidential race.
Some 200 supporters of the-then rising opposition MDC were killed. Hundreds
more were detained, with some allegedly tortured.
Former black liberation hero Mugabe had already earned the status of pariah
for stripping whites of their farms to the detriment of the economy.
After months of post-election wrangling and at the behest of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), Mugabe and Tsvangirai formed a unity
government - one that would remain too fragile to pull Zimbabwe out of its
economic misery.
""The coalition has failed. Our president cannot work with Tsvangirai. The
West will be ashamed when their puppet loses,"" one Zanu-PF supporter, who
identified himself only as Comrade Tongai, said.
""After that I am sure the agriculture sector will start getting money,"" he
told dpa.
Erica Nhambwe said she turned to selling fruits and cellphone credit on the
streets of the capital Harare after the beef company that had employed her as a 
clerk went out of business in 2007.
""All I want is elections get past and we resume our normal lives. I hope
peace remains whoever wins. I hope to get a decent job if Tsvangirai wins. I am 
tired of this,"" said Nhambwe.
Mugabe has allowed only African election observers into the country, much to 
the chagrin of his opponents.
On the campaign trail, the 89-year-old leader who came to power first as
premier after independence in 1980, urged his supporters to return him to
office.
Tsvangirai, 61, has expressed concern that the Zimbabwe Election Commission
is biased in favour of Zanu-PF, which holds sway over the security forces.
In 2008, the former trade union leader came out ahead in the first round of
voting but failed to secure the 50 per cent needed to avoid a run-off. This was 
the first time that Zanu-PF lost its dominance in parliament.
Tsvangirai, however, withdrew from the second round, citing high levels of
violence. He was himself badly beaten and arrested.
Mugabe, as the only presidential candidate, subsequently sailed back into
the top job.
The MDC has accused Zanu-PF of violating the power-sharing deal by running a 
parallel administration that moves state funds into the private coffers of
Mugabe and his inner circle.
Mugabe unilaterally called the poll date for July 31, despite Tsvangirai's
appeal for more time to prepare. The SADC called on Zimbabwe to delay the vote
by two weeks, but the High Court in Harare ruled in Mugabe's favour.
Human rights groups warned that sufficient reforms were not carried out to
ensure a legitimate vote.
When South African envoy Lindiwe Zulu voiced strong concerns that the vote
was not properly organised, Mugabe lashed out, calling her a ""street woman"".
Pretoria, seen as the key mediator in Zimbabwe, is frequently criticised for 
failing to openly condemn its rogue leader.
In 2003, following widespread criticism of the previous year's election,
Mugabe pulled out of the Commonwealth. This time around, he threatened to
withdraw from SADC.
Despite its record of having sent the economy into a decade-long tailspin,
with hyper-inflation, poverty and an exodus of skilled workers, Zanu-PF appears 
to enjoy broad support.
The MDC, meanwhile, faces dwindling support, in part because of concern over 
its partnership with Mugabe. Tsvingirai's private life - including failed
marriages - have tarnished his reputation in the relatively conservative
country.
In western Matebeleland, a traditional MDC stronghold, residents hold a deep 
grudge against Mugabe. They hold him accountable for the massacre in the 1980s
of an estimated 20,000 people, many of them supporters of his then political
rival Joshua Nkomo.
""Here in Matebeleland, we hope the next government will address our issues
of Gukurahundi,"" said Zenzele Matsche of the atrocities committed by the
military under Mugabe rule.
""We want industries back so that there is employment,"" the 44-year-old
former teacher added.
Polls are open from 7 am (0500 GMT) to 7 pm, with results expected within
five days.

9,"Women continue to be marginalised in the workplace and within the trade union movement itself, despite gains made in other areas of their lives, the Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) said on Thursday. This emerged at the organisation's National Gender Conference in  Johannesburg which ended on Wednesday. The conference found the unemployment rate for women as a whole stood at 50 percent compared  to 34 percent for men. As many as 75 percent of black women in South Africa under the age of 30 were looking for work. Cosatu's secretary general Zwelinzima Vavi said part of the reason for high unemployment among women was a virtual freeze on appointments in the public service since 1994. ""For decades nursing and teaching were almost the only way African women could gain a professional career. But this career path has been largely closed for almost ten years. As a result only  six percent of African women under 30 have professional jobs."" Vavi said some women were confronted by a range of problems including having to travel long distances to get water and having to care for those with HIV/Aids. However, he said Cosatu would be pressing for agreements made at  the recent Growth and Development Summit on poverty alleviation and  job creation to be carried out. ""The agreement on expanded public works including community services such as child care and sectoral strategies are critical to  generate more employment,"" said Vavi. A statement issued by Cosatu said the conference found there was  still much discrimination in the workplace and in the labour movement against working women. ""Generally, leadership is still male-dominated even in unions where women are in the majority. Conference therefore reaffirmed the resolution for quotas to be set for all levels of leadership."" The statement said current legislation was intended to give women more equality in the workplace, and Cosatu supported this. ""Conference thus adopted resolutions to intensify our struggles to change the workplace starting with a gender-sensitive collective  bargaining strategy."" The conference noted that while there had been great improvements in the quality of life for many people since the 1994 elections in the provision of basic services, access to democratic principles and rights and more enlightened labour policies, not all  was well on the horizon. ""Democracy has brought real gains to workers, including African women. However these gains are now under threat because of rising unemployment and the spread of HIV/Aids. Discrimination against women is still a problem in our country, including the workplace. Conference therefore urged Cosatu to intensify its campaign for an alternative economic strategy.""

11,"China’s overseas students return home to find love, before it’s too late

One-day girlfriend of my best friend's boyfriend
6 Mar 2013
It’s the stuff of Hollywood movies – meet someone, fall in love and get engaged in three days. For some it’s mission impossible, to use another Hollywood reference.
But a young Wuhan man did just that this past Lunar New Year holiday. What’s even more unbelievable is that he is a full-time student in Japan.
The 28-year-old, identified in a local newspaper only as Zhang, got engaged three days after he met a girl on a blind date arranged by his parents.
Worried Zhang would not find a partner on his own, his parents set up a date during his short five-day holiday from his studies in Tokyo. They demanded he take full advantage of it.
And he did. It was love at first sight.
“She has a baby face and hair that falls to her ears; she wears glasses and no make-up. And her smile is so warm it is like a spring breeze,” Zhang told Chutian Metropolis Daily.
Others are not that lucky.
Wang Zheli, 36, from Qingtian town in China’s eastern Zhejiang province, had 18 blind dates within 20 days during the new year break. The fact that he owns a small restaurant in Italy attracted many women, including nurses, teachers and public servants. In the end, he went on a second date with an accountant but gave no guarantees.
It’s typical for returning students like Zhang and Wang to look for poten

12,"The savage market ructions of recent weeks and days are disconcerting. While not unprecedented, the quite staggering fall in share markets and commodity prices are threatening to undermine the global economy. For Australia, the news is particularly alarming. Australia’s stock market, the ASX, has not performed well in recent years, lagging well behind the other markets. If the market ructions translate to an extended period of weak global growth, Australia’s already dismal export performance will be hampered and the commodity price weakness will further undermine national incomes. We are not there yet. There needs to be either further falls in stocks and commodities or an extended period where market weakness persists for there to be material damage to the Australian economy.

13,"Obama 'deeply troubled' by Iran violence 16th June 2009 10:02 AM WASHINGTON:US President Barack Obama said he was ""deeply troubled"" by Iran's violent protests brought on by a disputed election, but said the Islamic country was free to pick its own president. Speaking for the first time since Iran's election Friday, Obama said it would have been wrong for him to remain ""silent"" amid the reports of violence in Tehran and other major cities. ""It is up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran's leaders will be,"" Obama said after a meeting at the White House with Italian President Silvio Berlusconi. But he did say supporters of opposition candidate Mir-Hossein Moussavi ""feel betrayed"" by the result. Incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the landslide winner of Friday's election, sparking days of violent protests. His main opponent Moussavi has alleged

frontbencher Tony Burke has taken two free trips to China since last October to visit childcare centres built by a Chinese company run by businessmen and former political donors Ian Tang and Anthony Chan.Tang, Chan and the former deputy prime minister and Nationals MP Mark Vaile are the three directors of 123 AustChina Education Consultancy, which according to its website is operating and setting up childcare centres across China.Vaile is also chairman of the company.Soon after it won government in 2007, Labor came under intense pressure over free travel that senior figures – including Burke and the then prime minister, Kevin Rudd – had accepted from companies associated with Tang and other Chinese business figures while in opposition.From 10-17 October last year, Kazaru Pty, a company owned by the lobbyist and former Labor minister Nick Bolkus, paid for a trip by Burke to Beijing and Shanghai including airfares, accommodation and ground transport.

",5,"Labor frontbencher Tony Burke has taken two free trips to China since last October to visit childcare centres built by a Chinese company run by businessmen and former political donors Ian Tang and Anthony Chan.Tang, Chan and the former deputy prime minister and Nationals MP Mark Vaile are the three directors of 123 AustChina Education Consultancy, which according to its website is operating and setting up childcare centres across China.Vaile is also chairman of the company.Soon after it won government in 2007, Labor came under intense pressure over free travel that senior figures – including Burke and the then prime minister, Kevin Rudd – had accepted from companies associated with Tang and other Chinese business figures while in opposition.From 10-17 October last year, Kazaru Pty, a company owned by the lobbyist and former Labor minister Nick Bolkus, paid for a trip by Burke to Beijing and Shanghai including airfares, accommodation and ground transport.

16,"The application for a protective order against the planned DA march is to allow African National Congress members to protect their building, an official said on Tuesday. ""We are asking the court to allow ANC members to protect their building,"" spokesman Keith Khoza told Sapa. ""We are very suspicious of their Democratic Alliance behaviour."" DA leader Helen Zille will lead her party members in a march to the African National Congress's headquarters for ""real"" jobs on Wednesday. The party had originally said it would march to the ANC's headquarters, Luthuli House, in the Johannesburg CBD but this plan was thwarted by metro police. The party would instead march to Beyers Naude Square, a block away from Luthuli House. The DA has said it will be a peaceful march. Khoza said the ANC did not believe the DA would end their much at Bayers Naude Square. ""Their intention is to come to Luthuli House,"" he said. Khoza said the ANC was busy with court proceedings. The DA's Gauteng leader John Moodey rubbished the claims and accused the ANC  of grasping at straws. ""They are desperate because they know they can't keep control of their members. We are a disciplined organisation and comply with the law,"" he said. ""They are the ones who come with militant behaviour by sending out the MK Umkhonto we Sizwe with military uniform and intimidate people."" The ANC's Jackson Mthembu said in a statement that the move was necessitated  by information at their disposal of the DA contracting private security guards who would be armed to be part of the march. ""In addition they have booked a hospital, procured helmets and shields, and organised emergency services to be on standby."" He said it was clear that the DA had no intention of conducting a peaceful event. Mthembu said the application was to ensure that there was no potential for incidents of intimidation and provocation. When the DA first announced its intention to march, Mthembu warned the party  not to provoke the ANC. He warned the DA about what happened when it marched to the Congress of SA Trade Unions' office two years ago. Cosatu members clashed with DA supporters as they made their way to the lawns of the Joburg (formerly the Civic) Theatre, 50 metres from the trade union federation's office. Stones were thrown and a number of people were left injured. Riot police were alerted and teargas and water cannon were used. Mthembu said the ANC did not want to be put in the same situation and called  on the DA to reconsider the march. Mthembu on Tuesday claimed the march was part of the DA's ""desperate and high-risk stunts"" in order to capture the political limelight. ""However this time the risks they are taking places ordinary people in danger.  ""When they march with weapons and hired gunmen, they are taking us back to an era when violence and conflict defined our political environment,"" he said.

Kong.The foreign secretary and Tory leadership candidate warned Beijing that the UK would always put its principles before commercial interests, as he urged China to honour the “one country, two systems” agreement over Hong Kong.Tensions between the UK and China have risen since Hunt backed demonstrators in Hong Kong who have been protesting against an extradition law.On Wednesday China’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, accused Hunt of gross and unacceptable interference after Hunt urged China not to use the protests as “pretext for repression”.Hunt ratcheted up the row on Thursday by repeating his concerns and insisting the UK was keeping its options open on how it would respond.

",5,"Jeremy Hunt has refused to rule out imposing sanctions on China and expelling its diplomats in an escalating row over Hong Kong.The foreign secretary and Tory leadership candidate warned Beijing that the UK would always put its principles before commercial interests, as he urged China to honour the “one country, two systems” agreement over Hong Kong.Tensions between the UK and China have risen since Hunt backed demonstrators in Hong Kong who have been protesting against an extradition law.On Wednesday China’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, accused Hunt of gross and unacceptable interference after Hunt urged China not to use the protests as “pretext for repression”.Hunt ratcheted up the row on Thursday by repeating his concerns and insisting the UK was keeping its options open on how it would respond.

""We are unhappy with him as he is aggressive towards us,"" said one of the protesters, Patricia Maluleke, a nurse and representative of the National Education, Health and Allied Workers  Union. In their memorandum, the workers said the chief executive, Dr Mabatho Tshabalala, shouted at them, favoured his friends and practised nepotism at the hospital. They said he had closed down the adult education school and kitchen at the hospital without consulting them. ""When we ask him for something, he tells us that we must go and work in another hospital where the situations is better and there are no problems,"" said Maluleke. The protest at Rosettenvile was attended by cleaners, doctors and nurses. Jack Bloom, the Democratic Alliance's health spokesman in Gauteng, who attended the protest, said two more doctors had resigned from the hospital in the last three months. ""My view is that this hospital is in a serious crisis that can only be resolved with the removal of Dr Tshabalala,"" Bloom said. Bloom said he had previously expressed his view to the health MEC Brian Hlongwa about the hospital but effective action had not been taken. ""I hope that the MEC acts urgently to rectify matters at this hospital before conditions deteriorate further,"" said Bloom. Maluleke said staff were to meet official at the health department offices on Wednesday afternoon to discuss the matter. Officials of the department and the hospital were not immediately available for comment.

20,"Why the worst is yet to come for China’s cement companies and what that means for their stocks

China’s securities regulator warns of new economy IPO bubble

Chinese cement companies are facing the double whammy of an economic slowdown and falling prices, with analysts saying the worst is yet to come.
Against the backdrop of a sluggish economy with no significant stimulus plans expected to boost infrastructure investment, cement demand is expected to fall further, said Felix Lam, an analyst at China Construction Bank’s investment banking arm CCB International.
Last year cement demand fell 5 per cent, compared with the 8-9 per cent annual growth seen between 2010 and 2014, according to Lam.
Making matters worse, there have been reports of capacity expansion in the industry, which, Lam says, would put greater pressure on the already subdued cement prices.

With demand shrinking and capacity still growing, average cement price nationwide plummeted 26 per cent from 310 yuan per tonne at the end 2014 to 230 yuan at the end of last month.
According to Wei Sim, an analyst at HSBC, national high-grade cement prices are down 0.2 per from the previous week to 247 yuan per tonne.

regulator warns of new economy IPO bubble 15 Jun 2018 Chinese cement companies are facing the double whammy of an economic slowdown and falling prices, with analysts saying the worst is yet to come.Against the backdrop of a sluggish economy with no significant stimulus plans expected to boost infrastructure investment, cement demand is expected to fall further, said Felix Lam, an analyst at China Construction Bank’s investment banking arm CCB International.Last year cement demand fell 5 per cent, compared with the 8-9 per cent annual growth seen between 2010 and 2014, according to Lam.Making matters worse, there have been reports of capacity expansion in the industry, which, Lam says, would put greater pressure on the already subdued cement prices.READ MORE: Analysts still

bubble 15 Jun 2018 Chinese cement companies are facing the double whammy of an economic slowdown and falling prices, with analysts saying the worst is yet to come.Against the backdrop of a sluggish economy with no significant stimulus plans expected to boost infrastructure investment, cement demand is expected to fall further, said Felix Lam, an analyst at China Construction Bank’s investment banking arm CCB International.Last year cement demand fell 5 per cent, compared with the 8-9 per cent annual growth seen between 2010 and 2014, according to Lam.Making matters worse, there have been reports of capacity expansion in the industry, which, Lam says, would put greater pressure on the already subdued cement prices.READ MORE: Analysts still bullish on China’s big cement producers and

21,"Group leaders Lokomotiv hopes to confirm last-16 place in AFC Champions League lizheng DUBAI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Group A leaders Lokomotiv from Uzbekistan will be without midfielder Kahki Makharadze as they attempt to confirm their place in the knockout phase of the 2016 AFC Champions League when they face second placed Al Nasr on Wednesday evening. Makharadze picked up his second yellow card of the group stage in the 1-0 win over Iran's Sepahan to rule him out of a game that could see Lokomotiv earn their place in the last 16. Victory would seal their spot in the next round and also ensure Lokomotiv win the group while a draw would be enough if two-time champions Al Ittihad from Saudi Arabia do not defeat Sepahan. ""The match tomorrow (Wednesday) is very important for the two teams but we want to secure our qualification to the next round with a victory,"" said Lokomotiv coach Andrey Miklyaev. ""I hope that we can get a positive result and Al Nasr can qualify with us to the knockout stage. ""We are having a good season so far as we have avoided defeat in the local league and in the AFC Champions League. This is a result of the teamwork from our players and hopefully we can achieve history by qualifying for the knockout stage for the first time ever."" Al Nasr will advance if they can pick up the three points in front of their own fans or if both games in Group A are drawn, and Ivan Jovanovic's side prepared for the game with a comfortable 5-2 win over Bani Yas in the domestic league on Friday. ""We want to win tomorrow (Wednesday) night against a strong team who are having good performances in the competition,"" said Jovanovic. ""They are currently at the top of the group and they haven't lost any matches so far, which means the match will not be easy. ""We need a victory and we hope that we can achieve our target. Hopefully a victory tomorrow (Wednesday) will secure our place in the knockout stage. I hope that our fans will support us in big numbers tomorrow as we need them to help us win the match.""

'ALL WE ARE saying, is give peace a chance.' It was the chant  that  reverberated around the world in the 1970s. Mood rings, pet rocks, sea monkeys and lava lamps became the rage, along with streaking in public. The women's liberation movement was reaching fever pitch, holiday home du jour was an RV and a station wagon could be found parked  in most driveways.
The hippy influence of the 60s had now gripped the mainstream market, saturating the street with bell-bottom trousers, hot pants, platform shoes, clogs and colourful patchworks. Men  sported shoulder-length hair, and women, empowered by the movie Annie Hall, were adding to the confusion with their new obsession for traditionally male apparel such as  Derby hats, tweed jackets and baggy pants.
But while the rest of the world was captivated by this bubble of free love, a black cloud hung over the Swiss watchmaking industry. For centuries, the Swiss had  been at the forefront of the horological industry. By 1977, however, emerging Asian manufacturers were showing considerable potential, threatening the Swiss stronghold. Less than a decade later, in 1983, the newbies had gained such considerable ground that  Switzerland's share of the watch-buying pie fell from  43 per cent to less than 15 per cent. Hong Kong and Japan sat on the top two rungs of the industry, relegating Switzerland to  third, and Taiwan, mainland China and South Korea were hot on their heels.
The problem lay in an inherent Swiss stubbornness. They had been content relying on their traditional skills, crafting intricate, mechanical movements, and feeding the market these amazingly delicate works of art - watches that would become heirlooms and treasured for lifetimes to come. But people had embraced simpler aesthetics. Their Bohemian behaviour demanded products without thrills - and Japanese makers such as Seiko had caught the vibe. They introduced simple quartz watches which people lapped up,  a paradox  considering it was the Swiss, not the Japanese as is often believed, who invented the first quartz watch.
In 1978, the Japanese introduced a watch just 2.5mm thick. Not to be outdone, Swiss manufacturers upped the ante, creating  the Delirium Tremens. At just 1.98mm thick, it was flatter than a matchstick and  remains the slimmest wristwatch in the world.
But manufacturing the Delirium was expensive and a thin, costly watch would do

23,"Mother on the run with thee children after allegations of sexual abuse - SAPS ANA Reporter CAPE TOWN, December 31 (ANA) - The Cape Town Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit has urged the public to help trace a mother who has disappeared with her three children. In a statement released on Thursday, police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said the children are aged six, eight and 11. The 37-year-old woman, Shanaaz Shaik, allegedly fled Cape Town after allegations emerged that the children had been ""sexually violated"". ""The investigation started when the FCS unit was notified about alleged sexual violations that included three minor children, at a known guest house in Cape Town. The children were however taken for medical examination by the shocial workers of ACVV Cape Town. The reports later revealed that there were possible signs of sexual violations present on all three children. The outcome of these results were made known to the mother, whereby she disappeared with the children ever since,"" van Wyk said. Initial investigations indicate that the mother was travelling to Durban with her children on December 18. Van Wyk said various charges relating to the contravention of the Children's Act are being investigated. Meanwhile, the sexual abuse allegations remain under investigation. van Wyk would not confirm to African News Agency whether the mother was implicated in the abuse, but said ""that is part of our investigation"". ""We are appealing to the public for anyone who knows the whereabouts of Shanaaz Shaik, to please contact the investigating officer, at the FCS Unit Cape Town, Sergeant Sharon Appany on 021 467 6002 or 082 522 1084"". -African News Agency (ANA)

24,"Su Weiping marches into Beijing’s biggest Jaguar Land Rover showroom wearing a thick gold chain and an ear-to-ear grin. “I’ve bought this one,” said the 58-year-old businessman, pointing to a bright red Discovery Sport. He has just laid down 408,000 yuan (£42,000) for the British off-roader. “It’s for my daughter. She loves this brand!” Su said, as he inspected his purchase. “Everyone dreams of having one.” Selling the western consumer dream to the freshly minted middle class in China has helped propel Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) sales in the country from just a few hundred vehicles a decade ago to tens of thousands a year. That success prompted JLR to open its first factory in China last year in a £1bn joint venture with state-owned carmaker Chery to capitalise on the burgeoning appetite for its range of 4x4s, luxury saloons and sports cars. But more recently, sales of its upmarket “Chelsea tractors” have begun to slow dramatically in line with a slowdown in the Chinese economy. China was still JLR’s fastest growing market in 2014. However, as Beijing attempts to shift the country from an export-led economy to a more western-style consumer and services-led one, it has not been plain sailing. China’s economy grew at an annual rate of 6.9% in the third quarter of 2015, the slowest since the global financial crisis. That was well below the 11.7% rates the country was achieving during the industrial boom years of 2003 to 2007. It is also below Beijing’s official 7% target. With less cash sloshing around the economy, consumers have applied the brakes on spending. To compound matters, the JLR was hit by a one-off charge of £245m to cover the cost of a chemical explosion at Tianjin port in August, which damaged or destroyed up to 5,800 of its vehicles. In November, the carmaker warned that this year’s pre-tax profits would be lower than last, owing to some large investments in the business and losses from the explosion. It also launched a review of its costs that could lead to £4.5bn of spendin

a few hundred vehicles a decade ago to tens of thousands a year.That success prompted JLR to open its first factory in China last year in a £1bn joint venture with state-owned carmaker Chery to capitalise on the burgeoning appetite for its range of 4x4s, luxury saloons and sports cars.But more recently, sales of its upmarket “Chelsea tractors” have begun to slow dramatically in line with a slowdown in the Chinese economy.To compound matters, the JLR was hit by a one-off charge of £245m to cover the cost of a chemical explosion at Tianjin port in August, which damaged or destroyed up to

IF you can't beat them, pay someone to beat them for you. This is essentially the strategy employed by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) against the small Californian company of Napster. The Internet music-swap site has now won a reprieve that will allow it to survive, at least temporarily, until its lawyers appeal against last week's court order to cease its operations.
Payment by the RIAA in this case was in the form of fees to lawyers who argued that Napster violated copyright laws and damaged its members' businesses. Whatever the outcome of the forthcoming appeal hearing, the Napster case has highlighted a fundamental issue that the music industry has yet to tackle and that also challenges other areas of commerce as Internet users become ever more sophisticated.
The fact that information, in the form of text, pictures, video and audio, can be passed from one person to another through the Internet means that any company distributing such material via more traditional, and therefore controlled, means is now vulnerable.
Napster certainly appears to be in a legally precarious position and the lifting of the injunction granted to RIAA is likely to be a simple stay of execution. The plea by the company's 19-year-old founder, Shawn Fanning, to Napster's more than 20 million users to go out and buy CDs to demonstrate their purchasing power is little more than a ploy born of desperation.

PUBLISHED : Sunday, 30 July, 2000, 12:00am IF you can't beat them, pay someone to beat them for you.This is essentially the strategy employed by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) against the small Californian company of Napster.The Internet music-swap site has now won a reprieve that will allow it to survive, at least temporarily, until its lawyers appeal against last week's court order to cease its operations.The fact that information, in the form of text, pictures, video and audio, can be passed from one person to another through the Internet means that any company distributing such material via more traditional, and therefore controlled, means is now vulnerable.Napster certainly appears to be in a legally precarious position and the lifting of the injunction granted to RIAA is likely to be a simple stay of execution.

",5,"Record industry must face the music PUBLISHED : Sunday, 30 July, 2000, 12:00am IF you can't beat them, pay someone to beat them for you.This is essentially the strategy employed by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) against the small Californian company of Napster.The Internet music-swap site has now won a reprieve that will allow it to survive, at least temporarily, until its lawyers appeal against last week's court order to cease its operations.The fact that information, in the form of text, pictures, video and audio, can be passed from one person to another through the Internet means that any company distributing such material via more traditional, and therefore controlled, means is now vulnerable.Napster certainly appears to be in a legally precarious position and the lifting of the injunction granted to RIAA is likely to be a simple stay of execution.

It’s dog eat dog as China declares war on man’s best friend
29 Jul 2017
Now that everyone's a photographer, what's a photographer to do? In Florian Maier-Aichen's case, he looks back into the past and forward at new technical processes. Then he combines the two. He plays with images so that you're not sure if what you're seeing actually exists. Sometimes, experimenting with old film means there are mistakes. He likes that. That's when a use-by date, having expired, creates imperfect works in the present.
He's influenced by history - the history of photography, the history of his country, the history of photography in his country, which is Germany. Even though Los Angeles, where he lives for part of the year, has been the most important geographical space in his life (it freed him from Europe), you'd probably be able to guess, at least from some of the landscapes in his current show at Gagosian Gallery, that he's German. Guesswork is required because of the 15 works on display, 11 are titled Untitled.
Photography is so democratic now that it has low self-esteem
Florian Maier-Aichen
This sort of non-labelling can make a note-jotting journalist's, never mind a viewer's, heart sink. Despite his flaws, Damien Hirst - a former Gagosian stablemate - at least has a way with beefy captions you can chew over, such as The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living. Maier-Aichen, who's 40, clad in shorts, low-key, with wide-spaced eyes and a slight dreaminess that's more than simple jet lag, definitely isn't Hirst.
Why the lack of titles? ""Because I think everything is in the picture,"" he says simply. But he must have a way of distinguishing one from another in his head. ""We give them nicknames. This one [an abstract swirl of loops] I call Rollercoaster. But my wife nicknames it Dog.""
You wouldn't automatically assume that either Rollercoaster/ Dog or another Untitled (""I think the nickname for this is Splash""), with its explosion of paint, is a photograph. ""It's like animation,"" says Maier-Aichen, a fan of Chuck Jones, who directed many Looney Tunes cartoons. ""I do scribbling, fill in with acrylic and then photograph it. By default of that process, the end result is a photo.""
Sometimes, his work is highly technical, with overlapping use of exposures and complicated tweakings; sometimes he wants to be what he calls ""anti-scientific"", as he was when he created the huge, un

28,"The Latest: Federer reaches quarterfinals at Australian Open MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — The latest from the Australian Open on Sunday (all times local): 12:20 a.m. (Monday). Roger Federer ensured he didn't have too late a night on Rod Laver Arena, beating David Goffin 6-2, 6-1, 6-4 to advance to the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park.The four-time Australian Open champion didn't get on court until 10:45 p.m. because of to late-finishing matches in the afternoon and a subsequent delayed start to the night program. But the third-seeded Federer raced through the match in 1 hour, 28 minutes, finishing up shortly after midnight. Federer plays No. 6-seeded Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinals. ___ 10:30 p.m. Tenth-seeded Carla Suarez Navarro overcame a seriously slow start to rebound for a 0-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Russian-born Australian Daria Gavrilova and reach the quarterfinals. Buoyed by a partisan capacity crowd of 15,000 at Rod Laver Arena, Gavrilova won the first set in 25 minutes. But the Spanish player, using a vast array of shots, dominated the last two sets with five service breaks and dropping just one service game. Suarez Navarro will play No. 4-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska in the quarterfinals. ___ 9 p.m. Fourth-seeded Agnieszka Radwanksa has advanced to the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park with a 6-7 (6), 6-1, 7-5 win over Anna-Lena Friedsam, who suffered from severe cramping and was in tears for the last two games. Friedsam was given a time warning and then a point penalty in her last service game, conceding the game to Radwanska and a 6-5 lead. Radwanska then held serve to clinch the match despite trailing 5-2 in the final set. It's the fifth time in six years that Radwanska has advanced to the quarterfinals here as she chases her first Grand Slam victory. Radwanska will play the winner of Sunday night's match between Russian-born Australian Daria Gavrilova and Carla Suarez Navarro, ___ 8:15 p.m. Tomas Berdych has outlasted Roberto Bautista Agut in five sets to reach the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park for the sixth consecutive year. The sixth-seeded Berdych only converted four of 22 break-point opportunities against his Spanish opponent, finally prevailing 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 1-6, 6-3 in three hours, 18 minutes. Berdych reached the semifinals at the Australian Open last year before losing to Murray. His next opponent will be the winner of the match between Roger Federer and David Goffin being played later Sunday. ___ 7:40 p.m. An error-riddled Novak Djokovic has advanced to the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam tournament for the 27th consecutive time, persevering over a dogged and determined Gilles Simon 6-3, 6-7 (1), 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 in a 4-hour, 32-minute match at Melbourne Park. Djokovic advanced to the final eight and a match Tuesday against Kei Nishikori despite making a whopping 100 unforced errors, including four backhand drop shots into the net as he attempted, unsuccessfully, to get Simon to move up from his anchored position on the baseline. The five-time champion Djokovic and the pesky Simon played plenty of long rallies — the longest of which was 37 strokes. Simon frustrated Djokovic with his defensive play, saving all 11 break-point opportunities in the second set before dominating the tiebreaker. Overall, Simon saved 19 of 25 break points. ___ 5 p.m. Nigel Sears, the coach of Ana Ivanovic and father-in-law of Andy Murray, is expected to be released from a Melbourne hospital later Sunday, a day after he collapsed in Rod Laver Arena during Ivanovic's third-round match. The Australian Open released a statement from Sears in which he says he's been ""cleared to fly back home to the U.K. in the next day or so."" Ivanovic's match against Madison Keys was halted for about an hour on Saturday night while medics attended to Sears in the stands. He was carried out of the arena on a stretcher and taken to a hospital. Ivanovic had just won the first set when the match was stopped, but Keys came back to win in three sets. Murray was playing at the same time at Margaret Court Arena, and after he finished his match, he rushed to the hospital to check on Sears, who is the father of his wife, Kim. Murray's wife, Kim, is due to give birth to their first child next month. ___ 4:40 p.m. Now, Lleyton Hewitt's career as a professional tennis player really has ended. The 34-year-old Australian player had announced he would retire after this year's Australian Open. A center court ceremony was held for him Thursday night after he lost his second-round singles match to David Ferrer. The next day he was back in action in doubles with countryman Sam Groth. On Sunday, the Australian duo lost their third-round doubles match to Jack Sock and Vasek Pospisil, 6-4, 6-2. Hewitt walked off the court and into retirement to a standing ovation in the 7,500-seat Margaret Court Arena The match was interrupted for 20 minutes during the second set due to a medical issue in the stands that required medics to enter the arena. It was the third time this tournament that matches have been interrupted due to medical situations in the stands. ___ 3:35 p.m. Nick Kyrgios won't be sanctioned by tournament officials for answering his phone on court before a mixed doubles match at the Australian Open because the call was taken before the pre-match meeting. Kyrgios answered the mobile phone call, which he said was from a friend, before a match he and his girlfriend, Ajla Tomljanovic, lost in straight sets to the No.1-ranked team of Ivan Dodig and Sania Mirza on Saturday. Under the ATP Tour policy ""a player is not allowed to use any electronic devices (e.g. C.D. players, mobile phones, etc.) during matches, unless approved by the supervisor."" The Australian Open released a statement on Sunday saying, ""(the) referee reviewed the situation ... as Nick walked on to the court before his match he answered a phone call then hung up. This happened prior to the pre-match meeting and no further action wil be taken. The incident has been closed."" ___ 2:40 p.m. Six-time and defending champion Serena Williams is through to the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park after a 6-2, 6-1 win over Russian Margarita Gasparyan on Rod Laver Arena in 55 minutes. Under bright sunshine after the roof was opened following morning rain, Williams lost her service in the opening game but quickly found her groove to set up a rematch of last year's final with Maria Sharapova, who defeated Belinda Bencic in the preceding match. Williams has beaten Sharapova in 18 of 20 matches and hasn't lost to Sharapova since 2004. ___ 1:30 p.m. Kei Nishikori is the first male player through to the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park, defeating Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 in front of a hugely partisan crowd filled with flag-waving Japanese fans. The seventh-seeded Nishikori also reached the quarterfinals at the Australian Open last year and in 2012. Nishikori has had trouble with Tsonga's power game in the past, losing most recently to the Frenchman in the quarterfinals of the French Open last year. But Tsonga lost his serve five times in the match and only managed to break Nishikori once. The match was played under the roof at Hisense Arena after early-morning rain that delayed the start of other matches on side courts. ___ 1:20 p.m. Maria Sharapova is through to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open after a 7-5, 7-5 win over Belinda Bencic of Switzerland. The fifth-seeded Sharapova needed 2 hours, 5 minutes to beat Bencic, breaking the Swiss player's serve for the fourth time in the last game — sealing it when she successfully challenged a call on the baseline on the opposite end of the court. Sharapova, the 2008 champion and a three-time runner-up, needed four set points to clinch the opening set, including two in the 10th game. Bencic again found herself on the wrong end of an opponent's ace count. Sharapova had 21, including four on her second serve. Last year, Bencic was on the receiving end of a WTA-record 27 aces from Sabine Lisicki. ___ 11:15 a.m. Light rain is delaying the start of play on outdoor courts at Melbourne Park on Sunday, although matches on three covered stadiums have begun as scheduled. First up on Rod Laver Arena is Maria Sharapova's fourth-round match against Belinda Bencic. That will be followed by defending champion Serena Williams' match against Russian Margarita Gasparyan. Defending men's champion Novak Djokovic closes the afternoon program on the main court when he plays Gilles Simon. Roger Federer plays a night match on Rod Laver against David Goffin.

29,"Financing for Chinese developers slows to a trickle after credit crack down
As well as bank loans, alternative financing channels have shut their doors to developers

China property developers close with gains as monthly data shows sales rebound
15 Jun 2018
Credit flow to Chinese developers has slowed to a trickle after authorities further tightened the screws on funding sources since March, leaving overseas financing as one of the few options left for home builders.
In China, bank credit flows to developers mainly through mortgages. In the first quarter medium to long-term household loans – mostly mortgages – grew by 1.46 trillion yuan (US$212 billion), accounting for 34.6 per cent of total loan growth, according to the People’s Bank of China.
That’s down from 44.9 per cent last year. In 2016, the big four Chinese banks granted a combined 2.76 trillion yuan worth of mortgages, up 30 per cent from a year ago. New mortgages accounted for 81.8 per cent of total new loans at the Bank of China.
The upsurge in mortgage lending fuelled a more than 30 per cent home price rally in first and second-tier cities last year, but that looks set to change.
Under Beijing’s moves to rein in credit growth in the overheated property sector, the central bank has stipulated that banks’ outstanding mortgage growth in the first quarter cannot exceed that of the fourth quarter last year, in both absolute numbers and growth rate terms. Agricultural Bank of China, one of the big state-owned lenders whose mortgage growth rate last year was 32.8 per cent, vowed to keep growth rates below that amount this year while China Construction Bank also promised the same.
Another financing source for developers, corporate bonds, has also vanished. After an upsurge in corporate bonds issued by developers in 2015 and most of 2016, onshore issuance ground to a halt starting last October after stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen suspended developers’ bond sales

30,"The very idea of Phoolan Devi
Posted: Wed Apr 22 1998 IST
By this time next week, Phoolan Devi's candidacy to the Nobel Peace Prize will be history. But the mere fact that her name could be floated in the public sphere, sanctioned by political authority on another continent, picked up by the international media and reacted to by Phoolan herself in India, is sobering. Phoolan's candidacy is mildly amusing. The methods used to advance it are anything but. Long before Malthusian meltdown gets us, it appears, progressive advocacy will.

The prime mover of this funny-peculiar story is the touching human need to be seen as progressive. To be liked for one's ideas, just as people are liked for their clothes. No postmodern affliction, it has been with us at least from the dawn of the industrial age. A single instance will suffice to demonstrate that. Medical researchers in Guy's Hospital in Victorian London suggested that children working in British factories, the world's first sweatshops, suffered from rickets because they were denied sunlight. Rubbish, reacted AndrewUre, one of the first evangelists of industrialism. Everyone knew that the gaslight on the shop floors was just as good as the real thing! More important, it was progressive.

In the post-industrial world, we know better than to make an icon of progressive technology. Now, we make icons of progressive ideas, and flesh them out by draping them on people.



31,"US stock markets closed down almost 2% on Friday following sharp falls across the world due to investor’s renewed concern about the health of the global economy after the US Federal Reserve’s decided to leave American interest rates on hold. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 291.7 points ( or 1.75%) to 16,383 points. The S&amp;P 500 lost 32.09 points (or 1.6%) to 1,958.11 and the Nasdaq fell 66.72 points (1.36%) to 4,827.23 points. You can also read our updated news story here: Over in Athens tonight, Syriza has held a pre-election rally where Padomes leader Pablo Iglesias has just addressed the crowd with the opening line: “I will speak in Spanish because in Berlin they have to learn what Spanish and Greek sounds like!” He then went on to liken Tsipras to “a lion ... Noone has ever tried to defend your rights like Alexis.” The US Federal Reserve may have left interest rates unchanged but the central bank’s cautious comments about the outlook for the global economy sent shudders through global markets. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG said: “Markets can be a fickle thing. Going into last night’s Fed meeting, talk revolved around how damaging a rate hike would be to equity markets. It turns out that no hike can also be rather problematic, especially when accompanied by a sober statement and downgrades to economic forecasts. As a result, stocks moved swiftly into the red this morning and have stayed there all day.” European markets were harder hit than the UK, with the weaker dollar pushing the euro higher and causing concern for European exporters. So the closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 82.88 points or 1.34% lower at 6104.11 Germany’s Dax dropped 3.06% to 9916.16 France’s Cac closed 2.56% lower at 4535.85 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 2.65% to 21,514.90 Spain’s Ibex ended 2.57% lower at 9847.2 In Greece, ahead of the weekend’s election, the Athens market added 0.76% to 697.57 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 235 points or 1.42%. On that note we’ll close for the moment, but should be back to catch the Wall Street close. Meanwhile, thanks for all your comments. Christopher Vecchio, Currency Analyst at DailyFX, confirms that a US rate hike this side of Christmas is now less likely than before: The implied probability of a rate hike in October, per the Fed funds futures contract, dropped from near 45% yesterday to 18% today; for December, from above 60% yesterday to 26% today. Some analysts are arguing today that the Fed has created a new ‘third mandate’, on top of its existing dual duties to deliver price stability and maximum employment. Jeremy Zirin, chief equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management, says (via Reuters) “Investors are wrestling with how concerned they should be regarding global growth.” “The Fed has introduced a quasi third mandate about the global growth, apart from the labor market and inflation.” That means added uncertainty, which usually equals falling stock markets.... Every major stock market is in the red, with the exception of the Australian and Hong Kong indices which closed many hours ago before the rout got underway. Perhaps we can file today in the ‘inexplicable market reaction’ box. Bond trading veteran Bill Gross says the Fed made the right call last night, given financial market conditions. Speaking on Bloomberg TV right now, Gross suggests that the current era of non-standard monetary policy could last for another five or ten years. That would allow the problems created during the ‘fat’ decades of debt-driven growth pre-Lehman Brothers to be worked off, he argues. Gross concedes through that asset prices are simply too high, partly because they’re being priced against record low US interest rates and German bond yields. Ultimately, there has to be a rebalance if capitalism itself is to rebalance, Gross added. US markets have followed the rest of the world lower after the Federal Reserve’s concerns about economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost more than 200 points or 1.2% in early trading, while the FTSE 100 is now 1.6% lower and Germany’s Dax has dropped 3.49%, with investors worried about euro strength against a weaker dollar hitting European exporters. The Wall Street opening bell has been rung, and the New York stock market is open for business. The scale of today’s selloff is a little surprising, given that the markets didn’t really expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates rates yesterday. But they also didn’t expect the Fed to be quite so gloomy about the global economy. That dovishness is making investors around the globe reassess the prospects of a rate hike. Guy Dunham of Baring Asset Management in London explains: Federal Reserve slightly surprised market participants by combining a decision to leave interest rates where they are with dovish language, and revised down their median short and long-term expectations by 0.25%. Investors who hold risky assets are particularly uneasy, he adds, given the confusion over the timing of any rate hike. Here’s a reminder of how rate expectations have been pushed back: The Fed decision sparked a small rally in some emerging markets, but nothing sensational. India’s Sensex index jumped 2% earlier today, on relief that US rates hadn’t been hiked. The optimism has faded, though, with the index up just 1% in late trading. Viktor Shvets, head of Asian strategy at Macquarie Securities, predicts that the optimism won’t last. He told CNBC: “I think in the short-term, emerging markets will be supported because the Federal Reserve didn’t tighten. Basically, there’s little bit less pressure for U.S. dollar to appreciate, a little bit more liquidity. “There’ll be some relief particularly, in places like Indonesia, Malaysia, up to places like Brazil, South Africa, Russia. Will it last? The answer is no.” Traders heading to Wall Street this morning should take their best tin hat. Now this is curious. Someone in the City has sold shares in two blue chip heavyweights, BP and HSBC, way below the market value. Shares in both companies briefly dropped by almost 5%, before swiftly rebounding. It’s probably a ‘fat-fingered trade’, where someone presses the wrong button. But two at the same time suggests something went badly awry. Andy Haldane’s fascinating speech (online here) also outlines how Britain could introduce a tax on money. That would encourage people to spend, pushing up inflation, and avoiding the problem that it’s hard to cut UK interest rates much lower. Another option is to embrace an electronic currency like Bitcoin, which Haldane says has “real potential”. If paper currency were then abolished altogether, it would be possible to impose negative interest rates on deposits. As Haldane puts it: What I think is now reasonably clear is that the distributed payment technology embodied in Bitcoin has real potential. On the face of it, it solves a deep problem in monetary economics: how to establish trust – the essence of money – in a distributed network. Bitcoin’s “blockchain” technology appears to offer an imaginative solution to that distributed trust problem. Whether a variant of this technology could support central bank-issued digital currency is very much an open question. So too is whether the public would accept it as a substitute for paper currency. Central bank-issued digital currency raises big logistical and behavioural questions too. How practically would it work? What security and privacy risks would it raise? And how would public and privately-issued monies interact? The Bank of England’s chief economist is trending on Twitter after warning that the UK recovery is weakening, and may need a rate cut not a hike. The editor of the FT is leading the charge: The European selloff is gathering pace, led by Germany’s DAX index. The strengthening euro, and new confusion over when the Fed might hike rates, are proving to be a nasty cocktail for traders across Europe. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: The longer investors had to ruminate on Thursday’s Fed statement the worse they seemed to take it, with the European indices widening their losses as the day went on. An export-hurting rise in the euro-dollar was the main culprit, with the currency pairing jumping by around 0.4% as the morning continued. And with US stocks heading for a bath too, all the main European indices have shed at least 1%. The DAX is down 2.9%, back below the 10,000 point mark at 9,933. And here’s a reminder of how the euro jumped last night, when the Fed decision came. The futures market is now suggesting chunky falls on Wall Street when trading begins, in two hours time. The Bank of England’s chief economist is reiterating his opposition to an interest rate hike in the near future and says policy could just as easily be loosened as tightened if the UK is hurt by turmoil in emerging markets. Andy Haldane is using a speech to business owners in Northern Ireland to discuss events in the Greek economy and in China, where an economic slowdown has coincided with a stock market rout and sent jitters through global markets. Haldane, one of nine policymakers that vote on interest rates at the Bank, reiterated warnings he made earlier this year that the UK economy was not ready for higher borrowing costs. Haldane’s comments put him at odds with other members of the monetary policy committ",0,"So the closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 82.88 points or 1.34% lower at 6104.11 Germany’s Dax

32,"It is China’s web giant and has a string of high-profile investments spanning Snapchat, Spotify, Tesla and Hollywood film and TV. It is a sprawling corporate giant that has recently overtaken Facebook to become the world’s fifth most valuable listed company – but few, in the west at least, will have heard of Tencent, even though it is worth half a trillion dollars and rising. China is the world’s most populous digital market and the protection afforded by state censorship through the so-called great firewall – which has meant no competition from Facebook, Google, Twitter and Netflix – has helped Tencent flourish since it launched nearly two decades ago in Shenzhen. But in the last year the shares have been supercharged – climbing from less than HK$200 (£18) at the beginning of 2017 to HK$442 now – and the value of the company has soared. There are three cornerstones of Tencent’s business – its messaging app WeChat; the biggest mobile gaming franchises in the world; and an ecosystem built around its 1 billion users that apes many of the services offered by the Silicon Valley firms that do not operate in China. The company’s Netflix-style Tencent Video service – the biggest in China with exclusive content including NFL games and HBO series such as Game of Thrones – more than doubled in size in the last year, attracting more than 40 million paying subscribers. “They have a relationship of mutual benefit with the Chinese state,” says Jamie McEwan, an analyst at Enders. “They have been allowed to grow and massively diversify their businesses without the level of scrutiny or competition you might see in western countries.” Late last year, Tencent became the first Chinese firm to pass the $500bn stock market valuation mark, supplanting Facebook as the world’s fifth biggest firm, a bittersweet moment for company co-founder Ma Huateng, 46, also known as “Pony” Ma. In 2014, Tencent had been on the brink of buying What’sApp, which would have made it a global power player overnight. The company was close to a deal when talks had to be delayed so that Ma could undergo back surgery. A panicked Mark Zuckerberg got wind of the move and swooped, tabling an enormous $19bn rival bid – by far Facebook’s biggest deal and more than twice the offer made by Tencent – to see off the threat. Thwarted but undeterred, late last year Ma took a 12% holding in Snapchat (he had made a small investment in 2013) in a busy year that also included buying 5% of Elon Musk’s electric car firm Tesla and swapping minority stakes in its m

",5,"It is a sprawling corporate giant that has recently overtaken Facebook to become the world’s fifth most valuable listed company – but few, in the west at least, will have heard of Tencent, even though it is worth half a trillion dollars and rising.But in the last year the shares have been supercharged – climbing from less than HK$200 (£18) at the beginning of 2017 to HK$442 now – and the

33,"I have been shocked by the response in the Guardian to Trump’s inauguration speech (Report, 21 January). Have we learned nothing? Much of what he said should be being said by our own leftwing politicians. He spoke of decimated communities, closed industries and the outsourcing abroad of key work, leaving ordinary people scrabbling for low-paid and unreliable jobs, while the wealthy ruling class make decisions and policies which enrich a small elite. What is untrue here? Yet it was dismissed with sneering generalisms and personal attacks. I loathe the man and his views, but if we do not address the very real issues he references, and offer alternate solutions, we leave it to him, Le Pen, Farage, and others like them, to ride to power on a wave of social unrest. And we will deserve them. Jill Wallis Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire • I believe here is now a testable opportunity. Trump is in power. He has promised what we lefties have dreamed of achieving: full employment, efficient healthcare, welfare service at point of need, public education at all requisite levels, housing etc. We have blamed our failures on the capitalists who seemed to have successfully subverted all our efforts. Now, Trump has the support of money, legislation and mighty muscle; and he is backed by a bunch of outstanding capitalists with exceptionally high IQs in his cabinet.

advent of a third world war and the visible impoverishment of other countries and the degradation of the environment, will be a test of the force of capitalism.What were the Korean war, the Vietnam war, the Gulf war, the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq or, for that matter, the meddling of the CIA in countries like Iran in 1953, which removed the legitimate PM Mosaddegh and returned the ousted shah, the Bay of Pigs landing in Cuba etc, other than to serve the interests of the US?

35,"Zimbabwe's tobacco crop expected to top 200 million kg Barnabas Thondhlana HARARE, March 22 (ANA) - Zimbabwe's tobacco crop is this season expected to top 200 million kg, a harvest last realised in 1999 before the country's land reform programme, officials in the sector said on Thursday. Contract sales of the crop opened on Thursday, and earnings from the sale of the crop are also expected to increase by 16 percent. Before 2000, tobacco was grown by less than 4000 white tobacco farmers, but now more than 66000 black tobacco farmers have ventured into the lucrative crop. The crop is Zimbabwe's top foreign currency earner, after mining, and the 5.8 percent increase in harvest compared to last year will give the country a lifeline against biting foreign currency shortages. Some 186.3 million kgs were sold last year, mostly to China, South Africa and Belgium. The Tobacco Industry Marketing Board (TIMB), which regulates operations in the industry, has licensed three auction floors for the 2018 marketing season; Tobacco Sales Floor (TSF), Boka Tobacco Floors (BTF) and Premier Tobacco Auction Floor (PTAF). Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) statistics show that last year, tobacco generated $1 202 247 760 in export proceeds. China is expected to remain the top source market for tobacco exports. At the launch of the 2018 tobacco marketing season in Harare on Wednesday, acting President Constantino Chiwenga assured farmers that government would support the sector. ""The government has extended the tobacco contract model to the same category of the maize production programme, commonly known as command agriculture, which has recently been extended to cover wheat, soya beans, livestock, fisheries and wildlife production. So tobacco as from this coming season will also be on command agriculture,"" he said. The inclusion of tobacco under command agriculture is part of government's efforts to increase production. Ciwenga said tobacco had earned a strategic position in the Zimbabwean economy because of its contribution to gross domestic product and foreign currency earnings. He said more than three million people depended on the industry for their livelihoods. At the opening of sales on Wednesday, the bidding price for the first bale started at $6 per kg before going down to $4.90. Chiwenga said value addition was also needed for tobacco, which could increase earnings and provide an import substitution. ""Currently, 98 percent of all tobacco production is exported. Tobacco processing is partially being done by merchant companies, who remove stems and tips from the leaf before it is shipped abroad. This adds to a mere 30 percent to 50 percent to a crop's final export value. Value-addition would not only create the much-needed jobs in the downstream processing industries, but also result in increased earnings from the processed product,"" he said. ""The country would also significantly benefit from attained by-products such as pesticides and hair products. This will inevitably help reducing the unsustainable import bill through import substitution."" He commended the tobacco contract companies for financing 82 percent of the crop in 2017/18 season. In his monetary policy statement last month, RBZ governor John Mangudya said the tobacco input finance facility would be increased to $70 million this year from $28 million in 2017. Mangudya announced plans to float a Diaspora tobacco financing bond to raise funding. TIMB chairperson Monica Chinamasa said unfavourable weather conditions might affect the tobacco brought to auction floors. ""We had hailstorm damage as well in the beginning and then drought, excessive rains, so it depends at what stage the tobacco was at that time. It could impact, but we are praying that the impact is not too much,"" she said. - African News Agency (ANA), Editing by Stella Mapenzauswa

Bottom-up research pays off when it comes to assessing distressed debt
China-fuelled bond market boom has increased the number of risky borrowers, putting a premium on local knowledge when rating debt

In China's expanding apartment market, Sandra Chow and Cheong Yin Chin have figured out one way to tell whether properties are occupied: drive by and see if people are actually hanging their laundry outside.
Such on-the-ground research helped the two-woman Asian high-yield and distressed debt team at CreditSights decide to upgrade US$3.35 billion of developer Country Garden Holdings' dollar-denominated bonds on March 24, believing the sell-off triggered by the collapse earlier that month of Zhejiang Xingrun Real Estate was too extreme. Since then, Country Garden's debt has rallied as much as 9.1 per cent.
Getting it right when it comes to the region's riskiest borrowers has never been more important. Asia's corporate junk bond market has grown to US$87.2 billion as of the end of last year from US$15.2 billion in 2008, data from Schroder Investment Management showed. Borrowers in China are selling record amounts of notes and some are starting to miss payments. Indonesia's Bakrie group is seeking to avert a third default in 17 months while Australia's Qantas Airways lost its investment-grade rating.
""The hunger for yield means bottom-up research is even more important for money managers so they can discern good credit from bad,"" said Cheong, who joined CreditSights in December 2012.

37,"Norway killer found insane, unfit for prison 29th November 2011 08:40 PM OSLO: Confessed mass killer Anders Behring Breivik belongs in psychiatric care instead of prison, prosecutors said Tuesday after a mental evaluation declared him legally insane during a bomb-and-shooting rampage that killed 77 people. The court-ordered assessment found that the self-styled anti-Muslim militant was psychotic during the July 22 attacks, which would make him mentally unfit to be convicted and imprisoned for the country's worst peacetime massacre. The report, written by two psychiatrists who spent a total of 36 hours talking to Breivik, will be reviewed by a forensic panel before the Oslo district court makes a ruling on his mental state. Their conclusions surprised many outside experts and contrasted with earlier comments by the head of the review board, who told The Associated Press in late July that it was unlikely that Breivik would be declared insane because the attacks were so carefully planned and executed. But prosecutors insisted the psychiatric report describes a man living in a ""delusional universe"" — a paranoid schizophrenic who's lost touch with reality. ""After having read the documents of the case, the conclusion did not come as a surprise,"" Prosecutor Svein Holden told AP. Breivik, 32, has confessed to setting off a bomb that ripped through Oslo's government district, killing eight people, then opening fire at the summer camp of the governing Labor Party's youth wing. Sixty-nine people died in the mayhem at Utoya island, outside the Norwegian capital, before Breivik surrendered to a SWAT team. He denies criminal guilt, saying he's a commander of a resistance movement aiming to overthrow European governments and replace them with ""patriotic"" regimes that will deport Muslim immigrants. Investigators have found no sign of such a movemen

PR chap's not-so-clear  moment of lucidity
If the heads of public relations companies sometimes wonder why their messages don't make it into the newspapers or get badly mangled, they may consider the following not untypical exchange over the phone which occurred on Friday afternoon when our thoughts were straying towards the weekend.
'Hello, my name is Chris. Can you tell me who writes about bricks? There's a big bricks conference coming up in Beijing.'
Hmmm bricks doesn't sound like a hot topic but we'll humour him on this.
'Okay Chris, can you tell me where you are calling from and who you represent? we inquire.
'I represent South Africa. They are joining bricks. Who on your desk is going to be covering this?'
Chris, what do you mean 'joining bricks'?
'You know, like Brazil, Russia, India, China. South Africa have just joined.' Ah the penny drops, Chris is talking about BRICS, the term coined by Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill to describe the world's largest and fastest growing emerging economies.
Yes, we knew there was a conference coming up and China had asked South Africa to join what has now morphed into a club. We wondered why South Africa was joining since they are neither growing rapidly and have a relatively small economy - about a quarter of the size of the Russian economy. 'So Chris who is it you represent - surely not the whole of South Africa?' we inquired.
'A South African businessman,' he responded. 'But are you going to cover this event.'

41,"DRC humanitarian crisis needs urgent funding to be tackled - UN Mel Frykberg JOHANNESBURG, March 22 (ANA) – The Democratic Republic of Congo's ""massive and protracted"" humanitarian crisis can be beaten back if urgent and sustained funding is provided, the United Nations has said. The comments came after the head of the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) Henrietta Fore and the UN's top humanitarian affairs official, Mark Lowcock, from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), returned from a fact finding mission across the country. Fore said the funds were urgently needed to meet the needs of children, families and vulnerable communities, including people with disabilities. The two officials said the relatively peaceful political transition taking place in the DRC following recent presidential elections was an opportunity that should be seized. ""We can beat back the massive and protracted humanitarian crisis. But we urgently need donors to provide further generous funding as needs continue to outpace resources,"" said Lowcock, adding that the DRC needed sustained international engagement to create the conditions for peace, security and long-term development. While the country has made progress in some areas in recent years, including a drop in the number of children dying before they reach the age of five, the overall humanitarian situation remains alarming. Around 13 million went hungry last year, compared with 7.7 million in 2017. At least 4 million children are malnourished, while cholera, measles and Ebola ""continue to blight many lives"". ""Severe acute malnutrition is expected to hit 1.4 million children under the age of five this year and put them at imminent risk of death,"" said Fore. ""In conflict-affected areas of the country, children and young people have been recruited as fighters, sexually assaulted and denied education, health and protection services. Together, the international community and the new government can – and should – do better for children."" - African News Agency (ANA), Editing by Stella Mapenzauswa

""massive and protracted"" humanitarian crisis can be beaten back if urgent and sustained funding is provided, the United Nations has said.The comments came after the head of the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) Henrietta Fore and the UN's top humanitarian affairs official, Mark Lowcock, from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), returned from a fact finding mission across the country.The two officials said the relatively peaceful political transition taking place in the DRC following recent presidential elections was an opportunity that should be seized.But we urgently need donors to provide further generous funding as needs continue to outpace resources,"" said Lowcock, adding that the DRC needed sustained international engagement to create the conditions for peace, security and long-term development.While the country has made progress in some areas in recent years, including a drop in the number of children dying before they reach the age of five, the overall humanitarian situation remains alarming.

",5,"DRC humanitarian crisis needs urgent funding to be tackled - UN Mel Frykberg JOHANNESBURG, March 22 (ANA) – The Democratic Republic of Congo's ""massive and protracted"" humanitarian crisis can be beaten back if urgent and sustained funding is provided, the United Nations has said.The comments came after the head of the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) Henrietta Fore and the UN's top humanitarian affairs official, Mark Lowcock, from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), returned from a fact finding mission across the country.The two officials said the relatively peaceful political transition taking place in the DRC following recent presidential elections was an opportunity that should be seized.But we urgently need donors to provide further generous funding as needs continue to outpace resources,"" said Lowcock, adding that the DRC needed sustained international engagement to create the conditions for peace, security and long-term development.While the country has made progress in some areas in recent years, including a drop in the number of children dying before they reach the age of five, the overall humanitarian situation remains alarming.

PUBLISHED : Wednesday, 29 November, 2017, 2:53pm Tencent sets up an online trading platform for Chinese bonds 22 Jun 2018 A trade group has warned that members of the German business community in China are concerned about a request from the ruling Communist Party to set up cells in their companies – and some may even pull out of the market if the pressure continues.In a statement released last week, the Delegations of German Industry and Commerce in China – which represents the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce in China – said foreign businesses faced increasing challenges in the country as the party’s influence on their operations grew.China’s Communist Party makes big inroads into foreign-funded firms The body said it had received reports about attempts by the party to strengthen its influence on wholly foreign-owned German companies operating in China.There is no legal basis for such companies to promote the party.“We do not believe that

Wednesday, 29 November, 2017, 2:53pm Tencent sets up an online trading platform for Chinese bonds 22 Jun 2018 A trade group has warned that members of the German business community in China are concerned about a request from the ruling Communist Party to set up cells in their companies – and some may even pull out of the market if the pressure continues.In a statement released last week, the Delegations of German Industry and Commerce in China – which represents the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce in China – said foreign businesses faced increasing challenges in the country as the party’s influence on their operations grew.China’s Communist Party makes big inroads into foreign-funded firms The body said it had received reports about attempts by the party to strengthen its influence on wholly foreign-owned German companies operating in China.There is no legal basis for such companies to promote the party.“We do not believe that foreign-invested companies generally should be required to promote the development of any political party within company structures,” the statement said.

43,"Farmers belonging to the Transvaal Agricultural Union (TAU) will  not permit electioneering parties onto their farms during working hours, the union said on Tuesday. Unhappy that the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) had last  week signed a memorandum with Agri-SA and the African National Farmers Union (NAFU) to allow electioneering on farms, TAU said it would prevent political parties and the IEC from entering their property during the working week. ""No other organisation would allow work to be interrupted, why should farmers?"" argued TAU president Paul van der Walt. This follows the signing of an accord promoting the right of farm workers to vote. A memorandum of understanding to this effect was signed by Agri-SA, Nafu, farm workers' unions and the Independent Electoral Commission last Friday in Pretoria. It binds farmers to allowing IEC officials reasonable access to their property, and provides for workers to attend political rallies. Represented farmers also undertook to give their workers time off to vote.  On the other hand, the accord seeks to address the safety and security concerns of farmers by prohibiting unannounced visits by electoral staff or political party representatives. Chief electoral officer Pansy Tlakula said the signing was the culmination of a series of discussions that started last September.  The accord had been modified numerous times. A key challenge, she said, was balancing the right of access to voters with farmers' concerns for their safety TAU said it would not recognise the accord as it had not been party to its signing. ""The attendance of public meetings in public facilities is a personal decision. However, permission to set foot on private property remains the land owner's right and can not by signed away by anyone,"" Van der Walt said. He said there was plenty of time after work for the different parties to interact with the workers and there were lots of public places like schools to do it at. He argued many working days would be lost if all the parties contesting the elections wanted time with the farm workers. ""If you let some parties in and not others you are accused of bias,"" he said, stating that it had been decided to stop any group from entering a farm during working days.

Agri-SA and the African National Farmers Union (NAFU) to allow electioneering on farms, TAU said it would prevent political parties and the IEC from entering their property during the working week.This follows the signing of an accord promoting the right of farm workers to vote.A memorandum of understanding to this effect was signed by Agri-SA, Nafu, farm workers' unions and the Independent Electoral Commission last Friday in Pretoria.A key challenge, she said, was balancing the right of access to voters with farmers' concerns for their safety TAU said it would not recognise the accord as it had not been party to its signing.He said there was plenty of time after work for the different parties to interact with the workers and there were lots of public places like schools to do it at.

",5,"Unhappy that the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) had last  week signed a memorandum with Agri-SA and the African National Farmers Union (NAFU) to allow electioneering on farms, TAU said it would prevent political parties and the IEC from entering their property during the working week.This follows the signing of an accord promoting the right of farm workers to vote.A memorandum of understanding to this effect was signed by Agri-SA, Nafu, farm workers' unions and the Independent Electoral Commission last Friday in Pretoria.A key challenge, she said, was balancing the right of access to voters with farmers' concerns for their safety TAU said it would not recognise the accord as it had not been party to its signing.He said there was plenty of time after work for the different parties to interact with the workers and there were lots of public places like schools to do it at.

A year of living dangerously
December 22, 2016 00:00 IST
Along with a disturbing rise in attacks on Army camps across Jammu and Kashmir, the Line of Control and the International Boundary in the State are also alarmingly tense today
Pakistan’s decision not to respond to India’s surgical strikes after the terrorist attack on the Army base in Uri may have seemed at the time like a major political victory for the Narendra Modi government in New Delhi. But it is increasingly becoming evident that not only was the political victory short-lived, the country is paying a heavy price for the cross-LoC strike on September 29. While the Pakistan Army refused to admit that the surgical strikes ever took place, it has since been retaliating: unstated, surreptitiously and through proxies. Consider this: with Saturday’s attack on an Indian army convoy in Kashmir’s Pampore, the armed forces in Kashmir have lost over 60 men this year alone.
Along with this disturbing rise in the attacks on Army camps across Jammu and Kashmir, the LoC and International Boundary (IB) in the State are also alarmingly tense today. Ceasefire violation-related military casualties on the Indian side itself are 12 so far, highest since the ceasefire agreement — which has all but collapsed now — was arrived at in 2003.
Strategic implications of the strikes
From a military point of view, the cross-LoC operation was limited and carefully calibrated: there was no targeting of Pakistani military installations as the operation was claimed to be against terror camps and not against the Pakistan Army, and the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) telephoned his Pakistani counterpart after the operations ended and conveyed the counter-terrorist intent behind the strike. The DGMO further clarified that the “Indian Army conducted surgical strikes at several of these launch pads ‘along’ Line of Control.”
Moreover, the operation was hardly a surprise to Rawalpindi given the high level of political and military signalling from the Indian side between the Uri attack and the surgical strikes. The Pakistan Army is also said to have monitored a great deal of ‘operation-related chatter’ from the Indian side. Indeed, New Delhi’s post-strike triumphalism did have negative reputational impact on the all-powerful General Headquarters in Rawalpindi and for the Nawaz Sharif government in Islamabad. If so, why did the Pakistan Army not resist, or hit back after New Delhi hailed the military action as a blockbuster victory (even though we now know that such operations were conducted in the past as well)?
Does this mean that Rawalpindi displayed a certain amount of tolerance for the Indian military action given that it was carried out after 19 Indian soldiers were killed, and national anger was mounting in India? I recently asked a senior (retired) Pakistani General about the ‘level of tolerance’ for potential surgical strike-like action in future by India. I was told rather bluntly that it would depend on the Pakistan Army’s complicity in the attack: the more the complicity, the less the retaliation. Or differently put, no complicity would mean definite retaliation.
While this might appear to provide an operational window for future Indian military action across the LoC below the Pakistani redline, a proactive military strategy based on t

of living dangerously December 22, 2016 00:00 IST Along with a disturbing rise in attacks on Army camps across Jammu and Kashmir, the Line of Control and the International Boundary in the State are also alarmingly tense today Pakistan’s decision not to respond to India’s surgical strikes after the terrorist attack on the Army base in Uri may have seemed at the time like a major political victory for the Narendra Modi government in New Delhi.Along with this disturbing rise in the attacks on Army camps across Jammu and Kashmir, the LoC and International Boundary (IB) in the State are also alarmingly tense today.Strategic implications of the strikes From a military point of view, the cross-LoC operation was limited and carefully calibrated: there was no targeting of Pakistani military installations as the operation was claimed to be against terror camps and not against the Pakistan Army, and the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) telephoned his Pakistani counterpart after the operations ended and conveyed the counter-terrorist intent behind the strike.The DGMO further clarified that the “Indian Army conducted surgical strikes at several of these launch pads ‘along’ Line of Control.” Moreover, the operation was hardly a surprise to Rawalpindi given the high level of political and military signalling from the Indian side between the Uri attack and the surgical strikes.The Pakistan Army is also said to have monitored a great deal of ‘operation-related chatter’ from the Indian side.

",5,"A year of living dangerously December 22, 2016 00:00 IST Along with a disturbing rise in attacks on Army camps across Jammu and Kashmir, the Line of Control and the International Boundary in the State are also alarmingly tense today Pakistan’s decision not to respond to India’s surgical strikes after the terrorist attack on the Army base in Uri may have seemed at the time like a major political victory for the Narendra Modi government in New Delhi.Along with this disturbing rise in the attacks on Army camps across Jammu and Kashmir, the LoC and International Boundary (IB) in the State are also alarmingly tense today.Strategic implications of the strikes From a military point of view, the cross-LoC operation was limited and carefully calibrated: there was no targeting of Pakistani military installations as the operation was claimed to be against terror camps and not against the Pakistan Army, and the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) telephoned his Pakistani counterpart after the operations ended and conveyed the counter-terrorist intent behind the strike.The DGMO further clarified that the “Indian Army conducted surgical strikes at several of these launch pads ‘along’ Line of Control.” Moreover, the operation was hardly a surprise to Rawalpindi given the high level of political and military signalling from the Indian side between the Uri attack and the surgical strikes.The Pakistan Army is also said to have monitored a great deal of ‘operation-related chatter’ from the Indian side.

45,"(PICTURES) Leaders of the 79-member African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) bloc of poor and developing nations opened a summit on Wednesday to  discuss trade and develop relations with the now bigger European Union, their largest donor and commercial partner. ACP members are worried that the European Union, now with 10 new  members, will seek to scale back its aid to poorer countries or scrap preferential trade treatment. Leading the call for a level playing field on trade, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano -- one of the seven heads of state attending the opening ceremony in Maputo -- said the ACP's future relations with the 25-member EU would have to be reworked. ""We would like to reiterate that future trade relations between the ACP and EU need to be negotiated on open and transparent ground  in which not only trade issues are considered but also other issues  like development and the transfer of technology. ""Confronted with the demands and the rules of multilateral trade, there is a need to adopt a new ACP-EU trade relations framework that is compatible with the new reality,"" he said. Founded in 1975, the ACP, which groups 48 sub-Saharan countries,  16 Caribbean nations including Cuba and 15 from the Pacific, has been concerned with the failure of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks. A WTO meeting in Cancun in Mexico last September, aimed at breathing life into moribund trade talks that were launched in 2001, flopped over disagreements on scrapping agricultural export subsidies in industrialised nations as demanded by developing countries. Michael Ahern, minister of trade of Ireland, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, sought to dispel concerns that the bigger 25-member EU would turn away from development. ""The extension of the EU will allow ACP countries to export to new markets,"" he said, adding that Brussels remained committed to funding and fighting poverty and HIV/AIDS and trying to effect good  governance, peace and stability in the ACP nations. The EU points out that by disbursing aid between 2002 and 2007 to the tune of 13.5 billion euros (16 billion dollars), it is one of the largest international donors. ""Enlargement will allow the EU to strengthen its influence in the multilateral arena, especially in the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions"" to push the Millennium Development Goals for developing nations, Ahern said. The targets include halving by 2015 the number of people earning  less than one dollar a day, ensuring universal primary education, reducing child mortality by two-thirds and halving the number of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. The opening ceremony -- also attended by President Robert Mugabe  of Zimbabwe, Xanana Gusmao of East Timor, Botswana's Festus Mogae, Denis Sassou Nguesso of Congo-Brazzaville, Marc Ravalomanana of Madagascar and Azali Assoumani of the Comores -- also highlighted the HIV/AIDS pandemic ravaging many poor countries. Ahern spoke of the havoc AIDS was wreaking economically and socially -- a theme taken up by Fijian Prime Minister Laisena Qarase.  In sub-Saharan Africa around 26.6 million people are living with  HIV and AIDS, out of an estimated 40 million worldwide, according to UN estimates. But Qarase, whose country now hands over the presidency of the ACP to Mozambique, stressed that the main message of the club was: ""We would like the riches of the world to be distributed with fairness.""

opened a summit on Wednesday to  discuss trade and develop relations with the now bigger European Union, their largest donor and commercial partner.""We would like to reiterate that future trade relations between the ACP and EU need to be negotiated on open and transparent ground  in which not only trade issues are considered but also other issues  like development and the transfer of technology.Founded in 1975, the ACP, which groups 48 sub-Saharan countries,  16 Caribbean nations including Cuba and 15 from the Pacific, has been concerned with the failure of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks.""The extension of the EU will allow ACP countries to export to new markets,"" he said, adding that Brussels remained committed to funding and fighting poverty and HIV/AIDS and trying to effect good  governance, peace and stability in the ACP nations.The EU points out that by disbursing aid between 2002 and 2007 to the tune of 13.5 billion euros (16 billion dollars), it is one of the largest international donors.

",5,"(PICTURES) Leaders of the 79-member African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) bloc of poor and developing nations opened a summit on Wednesday to  discuss trade and develop relations with the now bigger European Union, their largest donor and commercial partner.""We would like to reiterate that future trade relations between the ACP and EU need to be negotiated on open and transparent ground  in which not only trade issues are considered but also other issues  like development and the transfer of technology.Founded in 1975, the ACP, which groups 48 sub-Saharan countries,  16 Caribbean nations including Cuba and 15 from the Pacific, has been concerned with the failure of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks.""The extension of the EU will allow ACP countries to export to new markets,"" he said, adding that Brussels remained committed to funding and fighting poverty and HIV/AIDS and trying to effect good  governance, peace and stability in the ACP nations.The EU points out that by disbursing aid between 2002 and 2007 to the tune of 13.5 billion euros (16 billion dollars), it is one of the largest international donors.

46,"Crisis talks were being held in Democratic Republic of Congo, Europe and at the United Nations on Monday to try to prevent more bloodshed in the vast central African country after at least 100 people died in 10 days of unrest. Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel, who arrived here Sunday on an ""emergency mission"", held talks with President Laurent Kabila  and other high-ranking members of the transition government, to try  to find a peaceful resolution to the crisis in DRC, sparked last week when rebellious soldiers overran Bukavu, a key town in the east. Michel said Monday the European Union was considering sending peacekeepers to Bukavu, where scores have died since the town fell. If an EU mission were to be mounted for Bukavu, it would ""work alongside MONUC,"" the UN mission in DRC, said Michel. He also said he was in favour of ""reinforcing the current UN mission in DRC and the means at its disposal."" MONUC currently has around 11,000 soldiers in DRC. Troops led by dissident general Laurent Nkunda drawn from a former rebel group, now incorporated into DRC's transition government, captured Bukavu last week, despite the presence there of UN peacekeepers.  At least 88 people are believed to have died in 10 days of fighting in and around the town. The UN peacekeepers' inertia as the renegade troops seized Bukavu triggered protests against MONUC in Kinshasa and other cities, in which at least 12 people were reported to have died. Nkunda began pulling his troops out of Bukavu on Sunday, but tension was still high in the volatile east, with Kabila openly accusing neighbouring Rwanda of backing the dissident soldiers. DRC armed forces head of staff Admiral Liwanga Mata-Myanumyobo reiterated this on Monday, and said his soldiers will ""fight and kick out ... Rwandans who are on our territory."" Regular DRC troops were advancing towards Bukavu on Monday, and the dissident soldiers were ""everywhere in town, taking up defensive positions,"" a MONUC official in Bukavu said. In a telephone conversation Friday with French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier, Kabila asked the world for help in containing the unrest in eastern DRC, which many feared would cause the country's fragile peace to shatter, diplomats said. The UN Security Council was holding talks on the situation in Bukavu, diplomats said Monday, and the French government said it has ""in the past few days had numerous contacts with partners"" about the unrest in eastern DRC. ""The international community is mobilised, notably through the UN Security Council... We are seeking the most effective means to resolve this crisis, in particular through diplomacy and with Kinshasa said Monday the crisis in DRC had been discussed by US President D-Day. The Belgian foreign minister urged DRC to continue its ntry ruled the central African country, the on. ""I have urged that this transition be consolidated from withiication of the aition government, which was sworn in 11 months  ago, is to guide the centralg into government of the former foes in  the five-yebel and other aroups into a national army. Nkunda and Jules Mutebusi, who led the dissident soldiers who captured Bukavu, are among diehard remnants of the RCD who have been reluctant to allow Kinshasa to re-establish its influence in the east of the country, most of which was controlled by the RCD during the war.

        ",1,"Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel, who arrived here Sunday on an ""emergency mission"", held talks with President Laurent Kabila  and other high-ranking members of the transition government, to try  to find a peaceful resolution to the crisis in DRC, sparked last week when rebellious soldiers overran Bukavu, a key town in the east.If an EU mission were to be mounted for Bukavu, it would ""work alongside MONUC,"" the UN mission in DRC, said Michel.At least 88 people are believed to have died in 10 days of fighting in and around the town.The UN peacekeepers' inertia as the renegade troops seized Bukavu triggered protests against MONUC in Kinshasa and other cities, in which at least 12 people were reported to have died.Nkunda and Jules Mutebusi, who led the dissident soldiers who captured Bukavu, are among diehard remnants of the RCD who have been reluctant to allow Kinshasa to re-establish its influence in the east of the country, most of which was controlled by the RCD during the war.

",5,"Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel, who arrived here Sunday on an ""emergency mission"", held talks with President Laurent Kabila  and other high-ranking members of the transition government, to try  to find a peaceful resolution to the crisis in DRC, sparked last week when rebellious soldiers overran Bukavu, a key town in the east.If an EU mission were to be mounted for Bukavu, it would ""work alongside MONUC,"" the UN mission in DRC, said Michel.At least 88 people are believed to have died in 10 days of fighting in and around the town.The UN peacekeepers' inertia as the renegade troops seized Bukavu triggered protests against MONUC in Kinshasa and other cities, in which at least 12 people were reported to have died.Nkunda and Jules Mutebusi, who led the dissident soldiers who captured Bukavu, are among diehard remnants of the RCD who have been reluctant to allow Kinshasa to re-establish its influence in the east of the country, most of which was controlled by the RCD during the war.

47,"Conflict has broken out between hundreds of protesters and police in riot gear in Hong Kong after tens of thousands of protesters marched peacefully earlier in the day to keep up the pressure on the government to withdraw its controversial extradition bill. The march, which continued late into the night, was the first since the storming and vandalising of Hong Kong’s legislature by protesters last Monday, a move that drew strong condemnation from the Chinese and Hong Kong governments. The extradition bill – which would allow suspects to be removed from the semi-autonomous city to face China’s flawed justice system – has been the subject of several mass rallies over the past month. The demonstration descended into chaos shortly before 11pm local time on Sunday with most protesters retreating and yelling “Leave now! Leave now!” as police in riot gear began to advance towards them. Police used truncheons to beat protesters, who were trapped as police advanced towards them in both directions, and pressed some of them on to the ground. Six people were arrested, according to a statement from the police just after 3am Monday morning. One protester was detained for “failing to produce proof of identity” and the five others were arrested for assaulting a police officer or obstructing the police. “Police respect the public’s freedoms of expression, speech and assembly. It is the policy of the police to facilitate all peaceful public events while at the same time ensuring public safety and public order. Police strongly condemn the illegal acts of protesters for blocking the roads,” the statement said. The atmosphere had turned tense earlier, with protesters who armed themselves with umbrellas and police in riot gear locked in a stand-off in the commercial district of Mongkok. The march – which had been given official permission by the police – started around 3.30pm local time at a park by the harbour front at Tsim Sha Tsui on the Kowloon peninsula, an area popular with tourists. Organisers estimated as many as 230,000 participated in the march, more than was expected. Police said only 56,000 attended.

to keep up the pressure on the government to withdraw its controversial extradition bill.The demonstration descended into chaos shortly before 11pm local time on Sunday with most protesters retreating and yelling “Leave now!Leave now!” as police in riot gear began to advance towards them.One protester was detained for “failing to produce proof of identity” and the five others were arrested for assaulting a police officer or obstructing the police.Police strongly condemn the illegal acts of protesters for blocking the roads,” the statement said.

",5,"Conflict has broken out between hundreds of protesters and police in riot gear in Hong Kong after tens of thousands of protesters marched peacefully earlier in the day to keep up the pressure on the government to withdraw its controversial extradition bill.The demonstration descended into chaos shortly before 11pm local time on Sunday with most protesters retreating and yelling “Leave now!Leave now!” as police in riot gear began to advance towards them.One protester was detained for “failing to produce proof of identity” and the five others were arrested for assaulting a police officer or obstructing the police.Police strongly condemn the illegal acts of protesters for blocking the roads,” the statement said.

48,"A bloody conflict between security forces and Taliban militants have claimed the lives of 10 armed insurgents in the northern Jauzjan province, while a bomb blast attributed to the Taliban outfit injured 24 civilians in the neighboring Balkh province on Thursday, officials said. ""Ten Taliban fighters have been killed and five others injured as a clash erupted in Qukal Dash area of Faizabad district, Jauzjan province Thursday morning,"" a security official, Zabit Khan told Xinhua. Khan, who commanded a unit of local police, said that the clash erupted after a group of Taliban militants stormed some police checkpoints in Qukal Dash area of Faizabad district early morning. Police returned fire, triggering a gun battle. The official, without commenting on possible casualties of security forces, said that the firefight is continuing in the area. In another violent incident, which occurred in Jauzjan's neighboring Balkh province on the same day, 24 people, all civilians sustained injuries in a bomb blast. The blast rocked a bazaar in Dawlatabad district of the northern Balkh province on Thursday, injuring two dozen civilians, a local official said. ""The terrorists planted explosive device in the cavities of a rickshaw and detonated it among people in the bazaar of Dawlatabad district at around noon, injuring 24 innocent civilians, some in critical condition,"" district governor, Amir Shah told Xinhua. Some women and children are also among the victims, the official added. Meanwhile, a doctor in Mazar-e-Sharif hospital in talks with Xinhua confirmed that 16 injured people, including a child and four women, had been taken from the Dawlatabad district to hospital for medical treatment. Eyewitnesses, however, said a few people died in the blast. An eyewitness who refused to be named told Xinhua that he saw two dead bodies at the site of the bombing. The district governor blamed the Taliban outfit for organizing the bloody bombing, saying militants loyal to Taliban often conduct subversive activities to terrorize the people. Taliban militants in an online statement on Thursday claimed that the militant group had killed seven police and injured five others in Balkh and Jauzjan provinces.

49,"European markets have closed higher, as traders welcomed a day without trade war escalation. Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 45 points or 0.6% to close at 7953, while the German DAX gained 0.9% and the French CAC picked up 0.75%. The reassuring noises out of Beijing today helped to calm nerves (although perhaps only temporarily), as did the German coalition deal on migration. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Stocks are higher as improved political relations in Germany and constructive trade comments from China has lifted investor sentiment. Angela Merkel has brokered a deal with Horst Seehofer which will keep their alliance intact. The positive mood might not last long though, as the Social Democrats need to inspect the agreement. An official from the People’s Bank of China announced they will not use the yuan as a tool in the trade spat with the US, and traders are taking this as a step in the right direct for global trading relations. That’s probably all for today. GW Time for a quick recap. Chinese central bankers have vowed not to use their currency as a weapon in the trade conflict with the U.S. The People’s Bank of China has pledged to keep the yuan stable, after seeing it slide to its weakest level in almost a year. PBOC insisted that Beijing is committed to upholding “multilateralism, globalization, free trade and rule-based global guidelines”, a roll-call of causes under threat from America’s protectionist moves. Sun Guofeng, head of the central bank’s financial research institute, told Bloomberg: “Recently the yuan’s exchange rate has shown some weakness. This is entirely due to changes in market expectations as external uncertainties rise rather than intended guidance of the central bank. China upholds multilateralism, globalization, free trade and rule-based international guidelines, and will not make the yuan’s exchange rate a tool to cope with trade conflicts.” PBOC also pledged to maintain the yuan at a “reasonable, equilibrium” level. This has helped to pull the yuan back up; earlier today it tipped below the 6.7 mark against the US dollar. Donald Trump has defended his policy of pushing other countries to reform their trade rules, or be hit with fresh tariffs. European stock markets are recovering from Monday’s losses. In London, the FTSE 100 is now up 76 points (1%) at 7622. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says European investors are relieved that Angela Merkel’s coalition crisis has been resolved. A day after the German interior minister offered his resignation over Germany’s policy on immigrants, a move that had serious implications on the country’s brittle coalition government, Chancellor Angela Merkel managed to pull Germany back from the brink with a last minute deal which has pacified the rebels in her government. There was a collective sigh of relief across European stock markets Britain’s construction sector has posted stronger growth. Housebuilding helped to push activity up last month, but Brexit uncertainty may be restricting big projects. There’s no wild dramas on Wall Street...yet anyway. The US stock market has opened calmly, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 109 points, or 0.4%. China’s central bank’s pledge not to use the yuan as a tool in the trade conflict with America is providing some reassurance. But, analyst Marc-André Fongern believes the PBOC may have to back up its words with actions, and prop up the yuan if it falls again. Indian industrialist S.M. Lodha has warned that Donald Trump’s attempts to shake up global trade will backfire. Lodha, who chairs UK insulation firm Western Thermal Limited, believes US firms will suffer as the EU, China, Canada and Mexico impose retaliatory tariffs. Lodha explains: “The trade tariffs imposed by President Trump on America’s closest allies including Canada, Mexico, European Union and India, are strategically misplaced and self-defeating as it stands to directly weaken the US economy. The US Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest lobbying group which has been historically close to Republican administrations, have themselves gone on record to denounce Trump’s erroneous idea of putting “America First” though trade wars. As President Trump’s steel tariff directly affects countries including Canada, EU and India, the EU has already warned that an estimated $300 billion worth of US goods could be hit by countermeasures. Even Canada has vowed to impose punitive countermeasures which can see over $12.6 billion worth of American goods being directly hit. Therefore, it is the American exporters who would be bearing a brunt over something the illogical and politically misguided actions of President Trump. If a country imposes tariffs on another, one can’t complain if they retaliate. This is a key ‘Art of the Deal’ Mr Trump seems to have missed.” Newsflash: China’s central bank has promised not to launch a currency war against America. Bloomberg has the details: China is committed to multilateralism, globalization, free trade and rule-based global guidelines, Sun Guofeng, director of the PBOC’s financial research institute, said in a written response to Bloomberg News. That’s an interesting pledge, given that the yuan (which is tightly controlled by Beijing) fell to an 11-month low today. Even the PBOC can only have so much effect - if Chinese companies and wealthy citizens try to move capital overseas, the yuan will fall. A weaker yuan also helps Chinese exporters, allowing them to cut prices and cushion the blow of US tariffs. Sun Guofeng’s pledge seems to be reassuring the markets, pushing the yuan a little higher against the US dollar away from today’s 6.7 low. The Treasury committee has been quizzing tax experts this morning, and hearing that online giants are still getting an unfair advantage. Charlie Elphicke, Tory MP for Dover and Deal, asked Richard Allen, the founder of group Retailers Against VAT Abuse Schemes, whether recent changes in the Finance Act had been effective in cracking down on VAT fraud by sellers on Ebay, Amazon and other online marketplaces. Allen replied that the measures were not tough enough and that legislation was “more relaxed” than in Germany. Elphicke asked: “Compared to Germany, our taxpayers are still being taken for a ride and Amazon are still in a position where they are not having to hand over information?” Allen agreed, saying: “Small traders get very annoyed when they find themselves being investigated for VAT when big companies don’t seem to get the same kind of attention. I was told by senior officials they’d been instructed, HMRC had been instructed not to go too hard on Amazon yet.” This has resulted in online firms having an unfair competitive advantage over high street retailers. “The regulatory environment in which these online businesses operate is not as tough as the regulatory environment for highstreet retailers.” Allen added: “You couldn’t sell dangerous products in a shop. You couldn’t openly sell goods where there is no VAT charge in a shop… There is a huge imbalance between online retail and high street retail.” His biggest concern is that online retailers are unregulated private marketplaces operated by one company. “The owner of a private marketplace online gets to see the sales data of everyone selling on that platform and can use that to their advantage selling products themselves.” This means “they can manipulate prices on their own marketplace,” Allen said, adding that Amazon sometimes sold lost leaders to maintain its market position. He is backing a VAT surcharge on overseas retailers selling goods in Britain – a similar measure is working

step in the right direct for global trading relations.China upholds multilateralism, globalization, free trade and rule-based international guidelines, and will not make the yuan’s exchange rate a tool to cope with trade conflicts.” PBOC also pledged to maintain the yuan at a “reasonable, equilibrium” level.But, analyst Marc-André Fongern believes the PBOC may have to back up its words with actions, and prop up the yuan if it falls again.As President Trump’s steel tariff directly affects countries including Canada, EU and India, the EU has already warned that an estimated $300 billion worth of US goods could be hit by countermeasures.Sun Guofeng’s pledge seems to be reassuring the markets, pushing the yuan a little higher against the US dollar away from today’s 6.7 low.

  ",5,"An official from the People’s Bank of China announced they will not use the yuan as a tool in the trade spat with the US, and traders are taking this as a step in the right direct for global trading relations.China upholds multilateralism, globalization, free trade and rule-based international guidelines, and will not make the yuan’s exchange rate a tool to cope with trade conflicts.” PBOC also pledged to maintain the yuan at a “reasonable, equilibrium” level.But, analyst Marc-André Fongern believes the PBOC may have to back up its words with actions, and prop up the yuan if it falls again.As President Trump’s steel tariff directly affects countries including Canada, EU and India, the EU has already warned that an estimated $300 billion worth of US goods could be hit by countermeasures.Sun Guofeng’s pledge seems to be reassuring the markets, pushing the yuan a little higher against the US dollar away from today’s 6.7 low.

50,"Tumbling share prices. A sell-off in commodity markets. Capital flight from some of the world’s riskier countries. Hints of a looming currency war. Financial markets ended last week in panic mode as fears emerged that the world was about to enter the next phase of the crisis that began eight years ago in August 2007. Back then, the problems began in the developed world – in American and European banks – and spread to the rest of the world. The bigger emerging markets – China and India most notably – recovered quickly and acted as the locomotive for global growth while the west was struggling. There was talk of how the future would be dominated by the five Brics countries – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – and by 11 more emerging market economies, including Turkey, Indonesia, Mexico and Nigeria. That has happened. Emerging market countries are dominating the news – but for all the wrong reasons. And because, after years of rapid growth, they now account for a bigger slice of the global economy, a crisis would have more serious ramifications than in the past. Emerging markets have a habit of causing trouble. For a quarter of a century after the Latin American debt crisis erupted in Mexico in 1982, the story was of a storm moving from the periphery of the global economy towards its core, the advanced nations that make up the G7. Mexico ran into fresh problems in 1994, there was an Asian debt crisis in 1997, and a Russian default in 1998 before the dotcom bubble burst in 2001. That proved to be a dress rehearsal for the near meltdown of the global financial system in 2007-08. Now the focus is back squarely on emerging markets. The problem is a relatively simple one. In the post-Great Recession world, the tendency has been for all countries to try to export their way out of trouble. But this model works only if the exports can find a home, as they did when China was growing at double-digit rates. But in the past 18 months, the Chinese economy has slowed, causing problems for two distinct groups of emerging-market economies – the east Asian countries that sell components and finished goods to their big neighbour, and countries that supply China with the fuel and raw materials to keep its industrial machine going. China’s slowdown has led to a slump in the price of oil and industrial metals. In theory, this should have no net effect on the global economy because lower incomes for commodity-producing countries should be offset by the boost to countries that import commodities. It hasn’t quite worked out that way. Consumers in Europe, Japan and North America have not used the windfall from cheaper energy to go on a spending spree. Meanwhile, emerging market economies are hurting badly. With the western economies one new recession away from deflation, China is making its exports cheaper by devaluing its currency just as oil producers are flooding the world with crude in a bid to balance their budgets. In the past three decades, there has been a crisis every seven years on average. Financial markets are well aware that recovery from the last downturn remains unfinished. The nervousness is easy to understand. China China sent markets into a spin this month after it revealed an 8.3% decline in exports in June. In an attempt to reverse the slump, Beijing began devaluing the yuan.

51,"Leftover Women should carry a health warning: this book will severely raise your blood pressure. Leta Hong Fincher's subject – researched through statistical analysis, sociological surveys and extensive first-hand interviewing – is the toxic vitality of sexism in China today. The book's title is drawn from a vile state-sponsored media campaign of the same name, which is designed to browbeat educated, professional women into early marriages in the interests of safeguarding social stability. Since at least 2007, newspapers, magazines, websites and – perhaps most troublingly of all – the All-China Women's Federation (a government organisation founded in 1949 supposedly to defend women's rights) have aggressively pushed the idea that unmarried urban females over 27 are ""leftover women"". These women may have university degrees and thriving careers but in the eyes of much of the state-controlled media they are essentially worthless without husbands and children. ""Do leftover women really deserve our sympathy?"" asked one article on the Women's Federation website. ""Girls with an average or ugly appearance … hope to further their education in order to increase their competitiveness. The tragedy is they don't realise that, as women age, they are worth less and less, so by the time they get their MA or PhD, they are already old, like yellowed pearls."" Although the Chinese media makes much noise about the country's epidemic of ""leftover"" single women, there are in fact far more ""leftover"" Chinese men, due to a traditional preference for sons and sex-selective abortions. By 2012, there were 117.7 boys to every 100 girls. ""The continual accumulation of unmarried men of legal marrying age,"" admits the Communist party's mouthpiece, the People's Daily, ""greatly increases the risk of social instability and insecurity."" In this context, Hong Fincher writes, single, educated women ""threaten the moral fabric … for being free agents, unnatural in failing to perform their duty to give birth to a child and tame a restless man"". The openly eugenicist Chinese state is particularly anxious to see educated, ""high-quality"" women marry, ""to produce children with 'superior' genetic makeup"". The social coercion of women into marriage has troubling economic consequences. Because urban women in their mid-20s are indoctrinated to feel already almost on the shelf, they often marry hastily and do not press for economic equality within their marriages. The urban Chinese today are preoccupied with buying a home. In cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, prices have skyrocketed in recent years, resulting in an extraordinary appreciation in real-estate wealth. Working women often contribute their life savings to securing a marital apartment, and siphon their salaries into mortgage repayments. Yet although more than 70% of women help finance the purchase of a marital home, only 30% of such deeds include the wife's name, and their contributions to mortgages are frequen

",5,"Leftover Women should carry a health warning: this book will severely raise your blood pressure.Leta Hong Fincher's subject – researched through statistical analysis, sociological surveys and

or PhD, they are already old, like yellowed pearls.""Because urban women in their mid-20s are indoctrinated to feel already almost on the shelf, they often marry hastily and do not press for economic equality within their marriages.The urban Chinese today are preoccupied with buying a home.

52,"An American who captains an Alaskan crab boat featured in a popular TV series told lawmakers Friday that the government shutdown risks causing king crab shortages on the Japanese market. ""If the Japanese buyers don't have Alaskan product on hand for the New Year's holiday they will source their crab from Russia,"" Keith Colburn, captain  of the Wizard, featured on the reality show ""Deadliest Catch,"" told the Senate Commerce Committee. ""If the crab isn't caught, processed, and shipped out of Alaska by the second week in November, we stand to lose access to that market,"" he said. Alaska's seafood industry contributed $4.6 billion to the state's economic output, according to a 2011 report by the Marine Conservation Alliance. In 2009, Alaska exported $1.6 billion worth of seafood to Japan, China, South Korea, Canada, and Europe. According to a report issued by the Senate committee on the impacts of the 2013 shutdown, ""a delay of even one week in the fishing season could mean that the opportunity to export to the holiday market in Asia would be missed, and Japan is the fleet's largest buyer."" Colburn said missing the holiday market would cut into his revenue by as much as 25 percent. ""Market watchers are already noticing uncertainty in the Japanese trade press over the Alaskan supply,"" said Colburn, who remarked that this is the first time in 28 years he has not been on the Bering Sea at this point in October. Colburn added that Alaskan operations are scientifically managed to prevent overfishing, unlike Russia's. ""The Russian king crab fishery is unsustainably managed and subject to a significant amount of pirate fishing,"" he said. ""This pirate fishing has already cost the Alaskan crab fleet an estimated $500 million since 2000. If this shutdown continues that amount will only increase."" The people who issue fishing quotas from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been sent home on unpaid leave as part of the government shutdown that began October 1. If his and other boats in the Alaskan fleet cannot get off the docks and start fishing as planned October 15, high prices may hit world markets and the US fishing industry could lose millions of dollars, he said. While the fishing boats are privately run, they depend on government-issued permits and quotas as well as federal observers, Colburn said. The Alaskan king crab season is only about two months long, but drives ""hundreds of millions in economic activity and provides thousands of jobs,"" Colburn said. ""I'm a small businessman, in a big ocean, with big bills. And I need to go fishing.""

Alaskan crab boat featured in a popular TV series told lawmakers Friday that the government shutdown risks causing king crab shortages on the Japanese market.According to a report issued by the Senate committee on the impacts of the 2013 shutdown, ""a delay of even one week in the fishing season could mean that the opportunity to export to the holiday market in Asia would be missed, and Japan is the fleet's largest buyer.""Colburn added that Alaskan operations are scientifically managed to prevent overfishing, unlike Russia's.""The Russian king crab fishery is unsustainably managed and subject to a significant amount of pirate fishing,"" he said.If his and other boats in the Alaskan fleet cannot get off the docks and start fishing as planned October 15, high prices may hit world markets and the US fishing industry could lose millions of dollars, he said.

",5,"An American who captains an Alaskan crab boat featured in a popular TV series told lawmakers Friday that the government shutdown risks causing king crab shortages on the Japanese market.According to a report issued by the Senate committee on the impacts of the 2013 shutdown, ""a delay of even one week in the fishing season could mean that the opportunity to export to the holiday market in Asia would be missed, and Japan is the fleet's largest buyer.""Colburn added that Alaskan operations are scientifically managed to prevent overfishing, unlike Russia's.""The Russian king crab fishery is unsustainably managed and subject to a significant amount of pirate fishing,"" he said.If his and other boats in the Alaskan fleet cannot get off the docks and start fishing as planned October 15,

53,"Nearly two weeks after Beijing launched one of its most comprehensive crackdowns on civil society in decades, at least six people remain missing – believed to have disappeared into the custody of China’s security services. At least 238 people have been detained or questioned since the clampdown began, according to the Hong Kong-based China Human Rights Lawyer Concern Group, which is keeping a tally of the operation’s targets. The missing – who include a trainee lawyer, a legal assistant and the leader of an underground Christian church – have not been seen since 10 July, after authorities began a major round-up of Chinese human rights lawyers and their associates. “We just really don’t know [what has happened to them],” said Maya Wang, the China researcher for Human Rights Watch. Most of the six are likely to have been spirited away into some form of detention where they face the risk of ill-treatment and torture, Wang added while others may have gone into hiding to escape such a fate. Beijing’s offensive against rights lawyers began on 9 July with the detention of Wang Yu, an attorney known for defending politically sensitive clients including five Chinese feminists detained earlier this year. China’s state-controlled media have rejected claims Beijing is waging a war against civil society. “Critics should first get the facts right, get to the bottom of the problem before embarrassing themselves in another unavailing episode of finger-pointing,” an editorial by Xinhua, Beijing’s official news agency, argued this week. The police action was “nothing more than a legitimate law enforcement action, and should not be interpreted as a human rights issue”, Xinhua added. However, activists, diplomats and academics all describe recent events as one of the most ferocious Communist party assaults on civil rights in memory. “The scope is unprecedented, not only in terms of who has been taken away, detained [or] disappeared but also in terms of the huge numbers of lawyers who have been taken in for questionings, warnings and intimidation,” said Eva Pils, a China expert from King’s College London. Keith Hand, an expert in Chinese law from the University of California, said: “Under [president Xi Jinping’s] leadership the party is showing a new determination to seize control of the ideological and political discourse in China and to marginalise any potential threats [to its power].” “Rights lawyers are one of the few groups in civil society that could put pressure on the regime so I think they are basically trying to take away what little space is left for them.” Of the scores of p

to have disappeared into the custody of China’s security services.At least 238 people have been detained or questioned since the clampdown began, according to the Hong Kong-based China Human Rights Lawyer Concern Group, which is keeping a tally of the operation’s targets.The missing – who include a trainee lawyer, a legal assistant and the leader of an underground Christian church – have not been seen since 10 July, after authorities began a major round-up of Chinese human rights lawyers and their associates.“We just really don’t know [what has happened to them],” said Maya Wang, the China researcher for Human Rights Watch.“The scope is unprecedented, not only in terms of who has been taken away, detained [or] disappeared but also in terms of the huge numbers of lawyers who have been taken in for questionings, warnings and intimidation,” said Eva Pils, a China expert from King’s College London.

",5,"Nearly two weeks after Beijing launched one of its most comprehensive crackdowns on civil society in decades, at least six people remain missing – believed to have disappeared into the custody of China’s security services.At least 238 people have been detained or questioned since the clampdown began, according to the Hong Kong-based China Human Rights Lawyer Concern Group, which is keeping a tally of the operation’s targets.The missing – who include a trainee lawyer, a legal assistant and the leader of an underground Christian church – have not been seen since 10 July, after authorities began a major round-up of Chinese human rights lawyers and their associates.“We just really don’t know [what has happened to them],” said Maya Wang, the China researcher for Human Rights Watch.“The scope is unprecedented, not only in terms of who has been taken away, detained [or] disappeared but also in terms of the huge numbers of lawyers who have been taken in for questionings, warnings and intimidation,” said Eva Pils, a China expert from King’s College London.

54,"It's not easy going green for Hong Kong's king of the trees
PUBLISHED : Monday, 21 March, 2005, 12:00am
As a soil scientist,  Jim Chi-yung loved nothing better than to run his fingers through rich earth - until he  returned to Hong Kong and came face to face with a concrete jungle.
Shocked by the city's greyness when he stepped off the plane at  Kai Tak Airport in 1981, he switched  interests from the expensive business of soil research to trees.
Clutching a PhD in soil science from the University of Reading,  he set about teaching in his old school - the University of Hong Kong - and  earned a reputation as Hong Kong's 'king of the trees'.
Twenty-three years later, the chair Professor of Geography at the University of Hong Kong is still championing the greening of Hong Kong. When trees are in trouble, Professor Jim is often the first person asked for advice.
Recently he was under the spotlight when the  Tai Po Wishing Tree lost a major limb. His immediate advice was to get rid of the concrete  around the base of the tree.
While he still visits the banyan tree, he has many more trees to watch over. Professor Jim, 52, has a vision - a comprehensive urban greening policy for the city he loves, and he has even gone as far as to draft his own legislation which he submitted to relevant government departments in 2003.
He proposed setting up an urban tree advisory board and a tree authority to plan greening strategies to care for, protect, remove and replant trees in the city.
But like the concrete walls that predominate in the city, so he found the stubborn mindset of government officials - all his approaches were rebuffed.
'They think that the many existing laws, some of which overlap others, are enough to protect trees,' he  says. 'But I think we need to remove the overlaps and draft a clear ordinance. The current rules are chaotic.'
Professor Jim warns that

12:00am As a soil scientist,  Jim Chi-yung loved nothing better than to run his fingers through rich earth - until he  returned to Hong Kong and came face to face with a concrete jungle.Shocked by the city's greyness when he stepped off the plane at  Kai Tak Airport in 1981, he switched  interests from the expensive business of soil research to trees.Clutching a PhD in soil science from the University of Reading,  he set about teaching in his old school - the University of Hong Kong - and  earned a reputation as Hong Kong's 'king of the trees'.Professor Jim, 52, has a vision - a comprehensive urban greening policy for the city he loves, and he has even gone as far as to draft his own legislation which he submitted to relevant government departments in 2003.He proposed setting up an urban tree advisory board and a tree authority to plan greening strategies to care for, protect, remove and replant trees in the city.

",5,"It's not easy going green for Hong Kong's king of the trees PUBLISHED : Monday, 21 March, 2005, 12:00am As a soil scientist,  Jim Chi-yung loved nothing better than to run his fingers through rich earth - until he  returned to Hong Kong and came face to face with a concrete jungle.Shocked by the city's greyness when he stepped off the plane at  Kai Tak Airport in 1981, he switched  interests from the expensive business of soil research to trees.Clutching a PhD in soil science from the University of Reading,  he set about teaching in his old school - the University of Hong Kong - and  earned a reputation as Hong Kong's 'king of the trees'.Professor Jim, 52, has a vision - a comprehensive urban greening policy for the city he loves, and he has even gone as far as to draft his own legislation which he submitted to relevant government departments in 2003.He proposed setting up an urban tree advisory board and a tree authority to plan greening strategies to care for, protect, remove and replant trees in the city.

55,"NEWS FEATURE Holders Spain looking for second win - and for improvement in play By Duncan Shaw, dpa Holders Spain will be looking for a second win at Euro 2016 Friday against Turkey in Nice - and for an improvement on Monday's late 1-0 defeat of the Czech Republic Madrid/Nice (dpa) - Holders Spain can secure qualification for the Euro 2016 round of 16 Friday by beating unfancied Turkey in Nice. La Roja - who are bidding to become the first team ever to win three straight Euros - are joint top of Group D with Croatia on three points, while Turkey have zero. However, the defending champions don't only want to win Friday, but also to improve on Monday's spirited but laboured late 1-0 defeat of the Czech Republic. ""Monday's win was a fairly good start,"" Radio Marca said. ""But now we want to see the team playing with more joy and speed, with more precision and penetration."" Rival station Cadena COPE remarked: ""Let's hope that Spain go from acceptable to excellent in the tournament,"" as it happened in 2012 when they started out with a disappointing 1-1 against Italy but ended up caning the Azzurri 4-0 in the final. ""With the quality of the players in the squad, good football and results are bound to follow soon."" Striker Nolito has echoed these sentiments, saying: ""I understand that not everyone is happy with the way we played the other day. ""But it is not easy being the reigning champions, playing against teams which defend in depth and leave hardly any space at all at the back..."" The Celta Vigo striker was full of praise for veteran playmaker Andres Iniesta, who set up the winning goal Monday for defender Gerard Pique. ""It's a real pleasure to play with Iniesta. I enjoy every moment I play alongside him. In 30 years, I'll be able to tell my grandchildren that I played with the great Iniesta."" Nolito also said he was pleased that defenders Pique and Sergio Ramos seemed to have finally ended their long-running feud. ""They are both important players for us, and have been for many years now,"" he said. Veteran manager Vicente del Bosque is likely to stick by young goalkeeper David de Gea, despite the allegations concerning his involvement in an ugly sexual assault in 2012. However, one player who might be benched is midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who looked slow and unsure of himself against the Czechs. The man poised to replace Fabregas against the Turks, who lost their opener 1-0 against Croatia, is former team-mate at Barcelona Thiago. ""I want to play as many minutes as possible, we all do,"" the Bayern Munich man said. ""The competition for places in the squad is massive, because all of the players are of very high quality."" Around 10,000 Spanish fans are expected to be in Nice Friday, hoping to see a win which will put the holders into the round of 16. # Notebook * * * * The following information is not intended for

56,"(=(File Picture)=) India's industrial output accelerated by a surprise 2.5 percent in March, its fastest pace in five months, data showed Friday, fuelling hopes that a sharp economic slowdown could be bottoming out. The March production growth from factories, mines and utilities beat financial market forecasts of a two percent rise and was up from a slim 0.5 percent increase in February. While output expansion is still far below double-digit rates in previous years when Asia's third-largest economy was booming, ""it's getting better slowly"", said Credit Suisse economist Robert Prior-Wandesforde. Three interest rate cuts since the start of 2013 should start feeding through to bolster consumer demand, analysts said, while export growth is improving with a sharply weaker rupee buttressing overseas sales. The output figures are ""generally in line with our view of a gradual uptick in activity"", said Goldman Sachs economist Tushar Poddar. The Congress-led government, buffeted by a string of corruption scandals, is  desperate for signs of better growth before facing voters in general elections due in the first half of 2014. The economy has been struggling under the weight of high interest rates in the face of uncomfortably strong inflation and sluggish investment amid fears about graft and disappointment with the slow pace of government economic reforms. Manufacturing, which accounts for three-quarters of the Index of Industrial Production, grew by 3.2 percent in March. Capital goods output of machinery and other products, seen as a key sign of investment intentions, grew by 6.9 percent and for the first time since mid-2011, posted back-to-back monthly rises. ""A recovery in capital spending is already under way and should slowly gather steam through the current fiscal year,"" said Prior-Wandesforde. Output of so-called consumer non-durables like food grew by 6.5 percent in March, the second strongest number since January 2012. But production of consumer durables, such as washing machines, fridges and furniture, stayed in the doldrums, falling by 4.5 percent, coinciding with the longest stretch of car sales weakness since records started being kept in 1997. Car sales slid by 10.43 percent last month from a year ago, according to separate industry figures, as still high borrowing costs and consumer unease about the economy put the brakes on discretionary spending. The government forecasts the economy will grow by at least six percent in this financial year, which began April 1, after estimated expansion of five percent last year -- its slowest rate in a decade. Industrial output will remain reasonably tepid, experts say, partly due to bottlenecks caused by dilapidated highways, ports, power shortages and other infrastructure problems which dampen growth. The government must make improving infrastructure, expanding fuel supplies and clearing long-delayed industrial projects a ""priority"", said Naina Lal Kidwai, head of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Business leaders were particularly alarmed by a grim energy situation. Manufacturing output ""is constrained by shortage of power. Electricity growth has decelerated to just half of what it was in 2011-12"", Kidwai said.

",5,"The March production growth from factories, mines and utilities beat financial market forecasts of a two percent rise and was up from a slim 0.5 percent increase in February.While output expansion is still far below double-digit rates in previous years when Asia's third-largest economy was booming, ""it's getting better slowly"", said Credit Suisse economist Robert Prior-Wandesforde.Manufacturing, which accounts for three-quarters of the Index of Industrial Production, grew by 3.2 percent in March.""A recovery in capital spending is already under way and should slowly gather steam through the current fiscal year,"" said Prior-Wandesforde.Car sales slid by 10.43 percent last month from a year ago, according to separate industry figures, as still high borrowing costs and consumer unease about the economy put the brakes on discretionary spending.

PUBLISHED : Saturday, 29 April, 2006, 12:00am OFTEN CALLED 'corporate wives', administrative assistants are the 'other halves' that control and take charge at most companies.Whether the title is office administrator or executive assistant, this role in an organisation may involve keeping schedules for the boss, being a problem solver for the team and being a customer service representative for the company.Administrative assistants are vital to any business because their roles are often at the core of organisations and involve connecting people and assisting team members to accomplish their goals.The traditional notion that those who cannot make it through school become secretaries is no longer prevalent.Administrative assistants in the global workplace are handling a wider range of duties beyond the traditional clerical roles as typists or secretaries.

",5,"Jack of all trades and master of the global workplace PUBLISHED : Saturday, 29 April, 2006, 12:00am OFTEN CALLED 'corporate wives', administrative assistants are the 'other halves' that control and take charge at most companies.Whether the title is office administrator or executive assistant, this role in an organisation may involve keeping schedules for the boss, being a problem solver for the team and being a customer service representative for the company.Administrative assistants are vital to any business because their roles are often at the core of organisations and involve connecting people and assisting team members to accomplish their goals.The traditional notion that those who cannot make it through school become secretaries is no longer prevalent.Administrative assistants in the global workplace are handling a wider range of duties beyond the traditional clerical roles as typists or secretaries.

Hunan Nonferrous  dives after unit  issues profit warning
Shares in Hunan Nonferrous Metals Corp dropped as much as 8.9 per cent yesterday after its Shanghai-listed unit Zhuzhou Smelter Group said net income probably fell more than 75 per cent last year on declining zinc prices. On a day when the Hang Seng Index rebounded 2.7 per cent, the stock finished at HK$4.74,  down 1.86 per cent. Zhuzhou Smelter, a 32 per cent-owned subsidiary and the country's largest zinc refinery,  accounted for about 30 per cent of Hunan Nonferrous' net profit in 2006 when it made 426 million yuan. Hunan Nonferrous executive director Liao Luhai  said the profit decline was mainly due to a provision for the decrease in the price of inventory. Carol Chan

ALBUM (1957) | South China Morning Post
Thelonious Monk
Brilliant Corners (Riverside)
The album many people believe stands as Thelonious Monk's finest hour had a difficult birth. The composer-pianist had signed to Riverside in 1954, and had already recorded two albums for the label - both trio recordings featuring bassist Oscar Pettiford, the first a tribute to Duke Ellington and the second a collection of standards.
By the time the first Brilliant Corners session was scheduled  on October 9, 1956, however,  it had been decided that this time  Monk (above right) would record his own compositions.
Two horns had also been added: Ernie Henry from Monk's band on alto and Sonny Rollins on tenor sax. Pettiford was back on bass, and Max Roach, fresh from the sessions with Rollins that were shortly to be released as Saxophone Colossus, was on drums. Both musicians were on peak form.
The first two tunes recorded, producer Orrin Keepnews later recalled, were a Monk blues -    Ba-lue  Bolivar  Ba-lues   Are  - and the lovely ballad Pannonica, dedicated to Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter who looked after

Thelonious Monk's finest hour had a difficult birth.The composer-pianist had signed to Riverside in 1954, and had already recorded two albums for the label - both trio recordings featuring bassist Oscar Pettiford, the first a tribute to Duke Ellington and the second a collection of standards.By the time the first Brilliant Corners session was scheduled  on October 9, 1956, however,  it had been decided that this time  Monk (above right) would record his own compositions.Two horns had also been added: Ernie Henry from Monk's band on alto and Sonny Rollins on tenor sax.Pettiford was back on bass, and Max Roach, fresh from the sessions with Rollins that were shortly to be released as Saxophone Colossus, was on drums.

",5,"PUBLISHED : Sunday, 09 November, 2008, 12:00am ALBUM (1957) | South China Morning Post Thelonious Monk Brilliant Corners (Riverside) The album many people believe stands as Thelonious Monk's finest hour had a difficult birth.The composer-pianist had signed to Riverside in 1954, and had already recorded two albums for the label - both trio recordings featuring bassist Oscar Pettiford, the first a tribute to Duke Ellington and the second a collection of standards.By the time the first Brilliant Corners session was scheduled  on October 9, 1956, however,  it had been decided that this time  Monk (above right) would record his own compositions.Two horns had also been added: Ernie Henry from Monk's band on alto and Sonny Rollins on tenor sax.Pettiford was back on bass, and Max Roach, fresh from the sessions with Rollins that were shortly to be released as Saxophone Colossus, was on drums.

61,"Face of English game in Asia ready to join the big league

If you think a  soccer player's lot these days is frantic, spare a quick second's thought for the people who surround the modern game.
Lots of the same sort of work to be faced - the long hours, the travel and the relentless pressure - but a whole lot less of the fanfare is what they can expect.
Good thing then that the majority would not have it any other way.

62,"Karwar to get India’s largest Naval base
10th  December 2012 09:19 AM
Following the Centre’s nod for Phase-IIA of ‘Project Seabird’, Karwar in coastal Karnataka is set to become the country’s biggest Naval base by 2025.
In fact, the official sanction granted last week for the latest phase of the ambitious project--with a whopping `13,500 cr outlay-- has the potential to transform the region into the country’s most important Naval base. It will also be home to the Navy’s submarine fleet in addition to having berthing facilities to accommodate as many as the 50-odd frigates.
The base will enhance the Navy’s operational flexibility and strategic advantage in the Indian Ocean region, including in anti-piracy efforts, a senior Ministry of Defence (MoD)official told Express. Actually, the move to set up an exclusive Naval base at Karwar is intended to decongest Mumbai on the West coast and Visakhapatnam on the East coast, as the two ports also have commercial shipping operations. Also, the decision was prompted by Mumbai’s proximity to Pakistan and the Islamic nation’s growing missile arsenal.
Karwar will also get a new Naval air station

coastal Karnataka is set to become the country’s biggest Naval base by 2025.It will also be home to the Navy’s submarine fleet in addition to having berthing facilities to accommodate as many as the 50-odd frigates.The base will enhance the Navy’s operational flexibility and strategic advantage in the Indian Ocean region, including in anti-piracy efforts, a senior Ministry of Defence (MoD)official told Express.Actually, the move to set up an exclusive Naval base at Karwar is intended to decongest Mumbai on the West coast and Visakhapatnam on the East coast, as the two ports also have commercial shipping operations.Also, the decision was prompted by Mumbai’s proximity to Pakistan and the Islamic nation’s growing missile arsenal.

",5,"Karwar to get India’s largest Naval base 10th  December 2012 09:19 AM Following the Centre’s nod for Phase-IIA of ‘Project Seabird’, Karwar in coastal Karnataka is set to become the country’s biggest Naval base by 2025.It will also be home to the Navy’s submarine fleet in addition to having berthing facilities to accommodate as many as the 50-odd frigates.The base will enhance the Navy’s operational flexibility and strategic advantage in the Indian Ocean region, including in anti-piracy efforts, a senior Ministry of Defence (MoD)official told Express.Actually, the move to set up an exclusive Naval base at Karwar is intended to decongest Mumbai on the West coast and Visakhapatnam on the East coast, as the two ports also have commercial shipping operations.Also, the decision was prompted by Mumbai’s proximity to Pakistan and the Islamic nation’s growing missile arsenal.

63,"Post-Snowden China looks to 'hack-proof' quantum communications
The holy grail of data encryption should, in theory, be safe from prying eyes

Edward Snowden a year on: Odyssey of the whistle-blower
13 Jun 2014
Ten months after Edward Snowden revealed the extent of the US' global surveillance programme, China started to build the world's longest quantum communications network, transmitting signals some 2,000km from Beijing to Shanghai.
Pan Jian-Wei, a quantum physicist with the University of Science and Technology of China who heads the project, told the journal Nature in April that the network would ""provide the highest level of protection for government and financial data.""
China is plans to launch the world's first quantum satellite, the Chinese Quantum Science Satellite, in 2016, Pan said. It will test how to teleport quantum particles from the space to the earth.
China is not alone doing this. A Switzerland-based start-up, ID Quantique, last October installed a 650km quantum link in the US, media reported. It is now looking to secure funding to build a network linking all major US cities, which could exceed 10,000km.
Quantum communication, which transfers information by using a technology called quantum key distribution, is the holy grail of data encryption. Theoretically, it is impossible to hack.
In quantum mechanics, connections are made between two points when photons of light become entangled.

theory, be safe from prying eyes PUBLISHED : Friday, 13 June, 2014, 5:07am Edward Snowden a year on: Odyssey of the whistle-blower 13 Jun 2014 Ten months after Edward Snowden revealed the extent of the US' global surveillance programme, China started to build the world's longest quantum communications network, transmitting signals some 2,000km from Beijing to Shanghai.Pan Jian-Wei, a quantum physicist with the University of Science and Technology of China who heads the project, told the journal Nature in April that the network would ""provide the highest level of protection for government and financial data.""China is not alone doing this.A Switzerland-based start-up, ID Quantique, last October installed a 650km quantum link in the US, media reported.Theoretically, it is impossible to

",5,"Post-Snowden China looks to 'hack-proof' quantum communications The holy grail of data encryption should, in theory, be safe from prying eyes PUBLISHED : Friday, 13 June, 2014, 5:07am Edward Snowden a year on: Odyssey of the whistle-blower 13 Jun 2014 Ten months after Edward Snowden revealed the extent of the US' global surveillance programme, China started to build the world's longest quantum communications network, transmitting signals some 2,000km from Beijing to Shanghai.Pan Jian-Wei, a quantum physicist with the University of Science and Technology of China who heads the project, told the journal Nature in April that the network would ""provide the highest level of protection for government and financial data.""China is not alone doing this.A Switzerland-based start-up, ID Quantique, last October installed a 650km quantum link in the US, media reported.Theoretically, it is impossible to hack.

64,"A South African television crew was arrested Friday by President  Robert Mugabe's secret police on an opposition stronghold in south-eastern rural Zimbabwe, the Movement for Democratic Change MP  which owns the property said. Roy Bennett, MP for the mountainous Chimanimani constituency, said the two journalists, whom he was able to name only as Frank, a  cameraman, and a reporter, Ngcibile, were detained while interviewing workers on his farm about a series of violent attacks about 10 days ago in which one of his workers was shot dead by a soldier. Police could not be contacted for Comment. There was no indication why they had been arrested. Bennett said he understood they were still under arrest. ""I am scared that they have been beaten up,"" said Bennett. ""These people (Mugabe's secret police) are brutal."" He had been trying to alert South African diplomatic officials in Harare. Bennett's farm, Charleswood, has been under virtual siege by ruling party militants, secret police, soldiers and police since he  overwhelmingly won the Chimanimani seat for the MDC in parliamentary elections in 2000. State security forces have subjected Journalists and opposition figures to constant harassment in Chimanimani with repeated arrests  and torture. The MDC reported 10 days ago that a farm worker had been shot dead by troops, other workers were tortured with hot iron bars, a young female worker was raped, the house of the farm manager was fire bombed and cattle were shot dead and maimed with axes as pro- government militias and soldiers went on the rampage. Bennett said the two journalists had been officially accredited by the Zimbabwe government's Media and Information Commission, whose authority is necessary for journalists to practise legally. Squads of soldiers, police and war veteran militiamen are encamped permanently on Bennett's farm despite court orders barring  them from entering the property. Bennett, the only white MP in rural Zimbabwe, is known to be popular among the local community of farm labourers and peasant farmers after he introduced a variety of development projects and provided food aid in times of famine, while President Robert Mugabe's government has been accused of ignoring the area.

Mugabe's secret police on an opposition stronghold in south-eastern rural Zimbabwe, the Movement for Democratic Change MP  which owns the property said.Roy Bennett, MP for the mountainous Chimanimani constituency, said the two journalists, whom he was able to name only as Frank, a  cameraman, and a reporter, Ngcibile, were detained while interviewing workers on his farm about a series of violent attacks about 10 days ago in which one of his workers was shot dead by a soldier.Police could not be contacted for Comment.There was no indication why they had been arrested.Bennett, the only white MP in rural Zimbabwe, is known to be popular among the local community of farm labourers and peasant farmers after he introduced a variety of development projects and provided food aid in times of famine, while President Robert Mugabe's government has been accused of ignoring the area.

",5,"A South African television crew was arrested Friday by President  Robert Mugabe's secret police on an opposition stronghold in south-eastern rural Zimbabwe, the Movement for Democratic Change MP  which owns the property said.Roy Bennett, MP for the mountainous Chimanimani constituency, said the two journalists, whom he was able to name only as Frank, a  cameraman, and a reporter, Ngcibile, were detained while interviewing workers on his farm about a series of violent attacks about 10 days ago in which one of his workers was shot dead by a soldier.Police could not be contacted for Comment.There was no indication why they had been arrested.Bennett, the only white MP in rural Zimbabwe, is known to be popular among the local community of farm labourers and peasant farmers after he introduced a variety of development projects and provided food aid in times of famine, while President Robert Mugabe's government has been accused of ignoring the area.

China’s soft power forays in Australian politics, a new report recommends the Australian government take practical steps to level the playing field, and exert some soft power of its own.The report from Wanning Sun, professor of media and communication at the University of Technology, Sydney, suggests the Australian government “could take the opportunity to use Chinese online media to exert Australian soft power and explain its position on controversial matters such as the South China Sea dispute.” It also suggests Australian business interests should be much more active on Chinese social media sites, like WeChat.The new analysis considers whether or not Chinese media outlets in Australia are now little more than propagandists for the regime at home.It notes that Chinese-language media in Australia used to be dominated by outlets catering to earlier Cantonese-speaking generations.“Nowadays a vibrant media landscape has emerged that targets a Mandarin-speaking migrant community from the People’s Republic of China,” the report says.

",5,"In a week dominated by controversy over China’s soft power forays in Australian politics, a new report recommends the Australian government take practical steps to level the playing field, and exert some soft power of its own.The report from Wanning Sun, professor of media and communication at the University of Technology, Sydney, suggests the Australian government “could take the opportunity to use Chinese online media to exert Australian soft power and explain its position on controversial matters such as the South China Sea dispute.” It also suggests Australian business interests should be much more active on Chinese social media sites, like WeChat.The new analysis considers whether or not Chinese media outlets in Australia are now little more than propagandists for the regime at home.It notes that Chinese-language media in Australia used to be dominated by outlets catering to earlier Cantonese-speaking generations.“Nowadays a vibrant media landscape has emerged that targets a Mandarin-speaking migrant community from the People’s Republic of China,” the report says.

67,"Oil spill from Dalian explosion spreads to cover 100 sq km of sea
PUBLISHED : Monday, 19 July, 2010, 12:00am
More than 400 workers scrambled to contain ocean pollution yesterday  as an oil leak from Friday's explosion of two crude oil pipelines in Dalian, Liaoning, expanded from 50 to 100 square kilometres within one day.
China National Radio  reported that the crude oil had spread much faster than efforts to contain the leak in Xingang Harbour, and one spill area of at least 10 square kilometres turned the water  black. Even the spindrift was black, which served as a warning that the oil could pollute popular beaches nearby if the wind changed direction.
Xinhua reported yesterday that 40 vessels had been deployed to lay booms  and throw felt cloth onto the water's surface to absorb the oil. It said one piece  of the cloth could absorb 35 to 40 litres of oil,  far from enough to deal with tonnes of leaked oil. The  booms laid to block oil from spreading were  extended from 7,000 to 9,000 metres, and authorities sent more than 30 tonnes of neutralising chemicals from Beijing, Hebei  and Shandong .
Even so, environmentalists said the government's rescue work was far from  adequate and predicted  worse developments from the massive  spill in the Yellow Sea.

Harbour, and one spill area of at least 10 square kilometres turned the water  black.Even the spindrift was black, which served as a warning that the oil could pollute popular beaches nearby if the wind changed direction.It said one piece  of the cloth could absorb 35 to 40 litres of oil,  far from enough to deal with tonnes of leaked oil.The  booms laid to block oil from spreading were  extended from 7,000 to 9,000 metres, and authorities sent more than 30 tonnes of neutralising chemicals from Beijing, Hebei  and Shandong .Even so, environmentalists said the government's rescue work was far from  adequate and predicted  worse developments from the massive  spill in the Yellow Sea.

",5,"China National Radio  reported that the crude oil had spread much faster than efforts to contain the leak in Xingang Harbour, and one spill area of at least 10 square kilometres turned the water  black.Even the spindrift was black, which served as a warning that the oil could pollute popular beaches nearby if the wind changed direction.It said one piece  of the cloth could absorb 35 to 40 litres of oil,  far from enough to deal with tonnes of leaked oil.The  booms laid to block oil from spreading were  extended from 7,000 to 9,000 metres, and authorities sent more than 30 tonnes of neutralising chemicals from Beijing, Hebei  and Shandong .Even so, environmentalists said the government's rescue work was far from  adequate and predicted  worse developments from the massive  spill in the Yellow Sea.

One of six Russian football fans released after attack in Germany
By Lena Klimkeit, dpa
Berlin (dpa) - Police in Germany on Friday released one of the six Russian football fans arrested on suspicion of attacking Spanish tourists in Cologne.
There was insufficient evidence to further detain the man, according to a police spokesman.
Police had applied for arrest warrants for the other five, who were due to be presented to a custodial judge later in the evening.
The individuals were also suspected of being in involved in violence in Marseille over the weekend.
The Russians, age 26 to 30, were arrested late Thursday after three Spanish tourists - two men and one woman - handing out flyers for a left-wing political movement were attacked near the Cologne cathedral earlier in the day.
Two of the Spaniards were injured.
Investigators said earlier the Russian men are part of a right-wing extremist group and were passing through Germany on their way back to Russia after attending the England-Russia and Russia-Slovakia matches at Euro 2016 in France.
ZIS, a police force which investigates football-related crimes, is looking into the men's potential participation in last week's violence in Marseille involving fans from England and Russia, as well as local youths.

Printed on paper left behind by the Japanese, it is now extremely rare, not least because – as the authors of The Chinese Photobook (Aperture) explain – it may be the first photobook “dedicated to Mao’s portraits and personality cult” and, as such, the precursor to an industry devoted to the deification of the great leader. As The Chinese Photobook shows, the history of Chinese photography is inextricably entwined with the history of its people. Until relatively recently, photobooks served as either a pictorial essay on Chinese places and people – or as a propaganda tool. During Chairman Mao’s reign from 1949 to 1976, they tended towards the latter, and seldom has one person been venerated so ceaselessly through the medium of photography. At the Photographers’ Gallery in London, an intriguing exhibition coincides with the publication of The Chinese Photobook. Like the book, it’s compiled by the Dutch photography duo, WassinkLundgren (Thijs groot Wassink and Ruben Lundgren) and – who else? – Martin Parr. If you’re considering shelling out around £100 ($150) for the book, the show is the best place to make your mind up. It is divided into six chronological chapters, each one neatly illustrating how photography reflected, and often idealised, Chinese culture through various periods – from the beginning of the 20th century, through the upheavals of Sino-Japanese war and the Cultural Revolution, and up to the present day. The earliest books, in the section titled From Empire to the People’s Republic of China (1900-1945), were made either by visiting photographers intent on capturing the exotic Other, or by Chinese photographers who referenced the country’s rich drawing and painting tradition. An early example of the former is La Chine à Terre et en Ballon (China: from Earth and Balloon), published in Paris in 1902, and comprising images taken by various French army officers sent to restore order in the wake of the Boxer Rebellion. Street scenes and aerial vistas sit beside images of the aftermath of the fighting, delicate ink drawings of flowers and birds and, as the caption notes, “real and imagined Chinese forms, including bats, bamboo and fans that appear more Japanese than Chinese

",5,"In 1945, the political department of the Shanxi-Chah’er-Hebel military region published a book called Recent Photographs of the Great Leader of the Chinese People Chairman Mao.Printed on paper left behind by the Japanese, it is now extremely rare, not least because – as the authors of The Chinese Photobook (Aperture) explain – it may be the first photobook “dedicated to Mao’s portraits and personality cult” and, as such, the precursor to an industry devoted to the deification of the great leader.As The Chinese Photobook shows, the history of Chinese photography is inextricably entwined with the history of its people.Until relatively recently, photobooks served as either a pictorial essay on Chinese places and people – or as a propaganda tool.During Chairman Mao’s reign from 1949 to 1976, they tended towards the latter, and seldom has one person been venerated so ceaselessly through the medium of photography.

Filibuster is part of democracy
Hong Kong has been criticised for lacking democracy.
For example, we still do not have universal suffrage for the election of the chief executive and we have functional constituencies.
What we need to keep in mind is that democracy is something that we need to strive for, instead of only chanting slogans and waiting for changes.
Filibustering is a democratic act which should be supported.
The tactics of lawmakers supporting a filibuster may seem outrageous to the public because people are not familiar with it.
They think this act is a nuisance which will place a heavy burden on taxpayers and hinder our progress in tackling urgent issues.
But the People Power lawmakers were trying to raise awareness about the by-election bill. The more than 1,300 amendments to the bill were not a waste of time but a meaningful act.
A filibuster is an inseparable part of a democratic system and should not be banned.
It was a tactic which was employed in ancient Rome and is an acceptable tactic in many modern democracies such as Britain, Canada and the US.
We should treasure the opportunity to embrace democracy through a filibuster.
It is high time Hong Kong people realised the meaning behind the act and that it is not good to be at the mercy of the government.

Allegations have not been proved
Your editorial ('National education needs impartiality', May 17) objected to the exclusion of 'the June 4 crackdown and the suppression of civil right lawyers on the mainland' from the curriculum guide on national education. I have no doubt many people share your view, most notably the Professional Teachers' Union.
The union objects because its members will lose the freedom to continue brainwashing generations of schoolchildren with allegations of atrocities committed by the Beijing authorities, for which credible evidence has not been produced.
The most notable of  some teachers' allegations is that the central government ordered tanks to roll over students while they slept in their tents in Tiananmen Square. Many Western reporters' eyewitness accounts dispute such a claim.
The forthcoming June 4 vigil in Victoria Park will be a timely opportunity for all unbiased eyes to see that allegations are not substantiated.
With all the hi-tech espionage equipment available to the many foreign agents present in Beijing in 1989, how could there not have been any film recording showing the deaths which allegedly happened?
If we can't have unbiased information to pass on to future generations, the best thing to do is not to talk about it.
As to the truth

Taste of Tai Wai | South China Morning Post
Tai Wai,   a small  town closely  connected with Sha Tin,    nestles in the shadow of Lion Rock. The hamlet's history dates back to the Ming dynasty  when  indigenous people built a cluster of fortified villages  and  called it Chik Chuen Wai.  Owing to its close proximity to  Shing Mun River,  Tai Wai was a glorious sprawl of fertile paddy fields, with urban development slowly encroaching only in the  past 30 years.
Today, the original  walled village remains almost unchanged, but next to this historical monument is a sprawl of low-density residential buildings. And where there are people, there are restaurants.  There's still an array of local independent eateries such as wonton noodle shops and dessert houses, and Shanghainese, Japanese and Thai are also popular choices.
But a couple of  establishments have stood the test of time to become  iconic destinations for foodies. Fung Lam Restaurant  is the grande dame of Tai Wai. Established and run by the Pang  family half  a century ago, it started off as a  family restaurant with six tables in the former Sha Tin old town. In 1977, it moved to its current 400-seat location.  Owner   Pang Chien-ting,  82, can be found every day holding court behind the cashier counter as he oversees a team of 30 familiar faces who have all worked for him for more than 10 years.
Dining  there now is like taking a trip back in time to old Hong Kong.  Sturdy teak fixtures such as the chairs, tables, staircases and panels, and  the stone fish pond were   built 30 years ago by local craftsmen, whose skills  are now hard to find.
Signature dishes include chilli pepper prawns, fried stuffed tofu with shrimp paste and braised  duck with yam. Don't miss the dumplings in sweet walnut  soup,  which is made every day with freshly ground nuts.
Pang says: 'My head chef  has been with us for  40 years.  Except for seasonal dishes, we don't change much  on the menu.  These are all traditional Cantonese dishes  that my customers come especially to eat.  Our raw ingredients are fresh and basic,  but it takes the skill of a chef to mix them  and create new combinations. This is what differentiates us from other restaurants.'
Fung Lam has  built a reputation for its friendly service as well as its food.   Regular customers are

72,"Zhang Jinling is picking cardboard boxes from a trash can on the side of the road in a downtown area of Shanghai. She empties the boxes, folds them and puts them on a trailer hitched to a bicycle. She also buys cardboard from residents in the houses on the same street, purchasing it for 2.5 mao (less than 3p) for a pile. When her trailer is full, she takes the load to a recycling market on the outskirts of the city where she sells each pile for a 1p profit. Markets like these sort waste into different materials and sell it to bigger markets where it ends up at big industrial recycling plants for individual materials. Jinling is one of hundreds of thousands of waste pickers working in cities across China sorting through other people’s rubbish, removing and sorting anything that can be recycled and selling it for a meagre profit. Most people working in this sector are migrant workers from the countryside who come to big cities to try to make a living. Further down the street, Guan (who didn’t wish to give his full name) is buying cardboard from a small fruit shop. He has been doing this job for almost eight years and makes a daily profit of £10. Guan and Jinling are collecting recyclables in one of Shanghai’s most desirable and expensive neighbourhoods but their living standards are very different from the people who live there. Jinling lives with her husband in a 6 metre square apartment in a compound where thousands of other migrant workers live. “I would prefer not to do this work,” she says. “I would rather work for a factory or company.” Unpredictable nature of informal

       ",0,"She also buys cardboard from residents in the houses on the same street, purchasing it for 2.5 mao (less than 3p) for a pile.When her trailer is full, she takes the load to a recycling market on the outskirts of the city where she sells each pile for a 1p profit.Markets like these sort waste into different materials and sell it to bigger markets where it ends up at big industrial recycling plants for individual materials.Jinling is one of hundreds of thousands of waste pickers working in cities across China sorting through other people’s rubbish, removing and sorting anything that can be recycled and selling it for a meagre profit.Most people working in this sector are migrant workers from the countryside who come to big cities to try to make a living.

",5,"She also buys cardboard from residents in the houses on the same street, purchasing it for 2.5 mao (less than 3p) for a pile.When her trailer is full, she takes the load to a recycling market on the outskirts of the city where she sells each pile for a 1p profit.Markets like these sort waste into different materials and sell it to bigger markets where it ends up at big industrial recycling plants for individual materials.Jinling is one of hundreds of thousands of waste pickers working in cities across China sorting through other people’s rubbish, removing and sorting anything that can be recycled and selling it for a meagre profit.Most people working in this sector are migrant workers from the countryside who come to big cities to try to make a living.

73,"New Zealand airport operator Auckland International Airport Ltd. said Thursday it posted an annual net profit of 92 million New Zealand dollars (US{dollar}65 million; ?48 million) - an 11 percent fall from NZ{dollar}103.2  million (US{dollar}73 million; ?54 million) a year earlier. The profit for the 12 months to June 30 was in line with its guidance, the operator of the nation's main international gateway said,  as investors remained focussed on a takeover bid from Dubai Aerospace Enterprises. The airport company noted its result was at the top end of its NZ{dollar}91-92 million (US{dollar}64-65 million; ?47-48 million) guidance issued in July. Profit was hurt by a NZ{dollar}9.9 million (US{dollar}7 million; ?5.2 million) provision for its long-term incentive schemes for senior management and  staff due to a significant rise in the company's share price. Modest growth in passengers and higher interest costs associated with stepped-up capital expenditure also restrained earnings during the  year. Auckland Airport remains positive about its outlook, predicting operating profit and revenue growth of 7 percent in fiscal 2008. Earnings growth at the airport has slowed over the past two years on  softening passenger volumes, and due to high capital expenditure linked  to an expansion of key services. But analysts note the company's strong position in New Zealand will generate solid long-term returns. The NZ{dollar}2.6 billion (US1.8 {dollar}million; ?1.4 million) takeover bid made in July by the Dubai company, which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, underscored the airport's attractiveness, they said. The deal needs approval from 75 percent of shareholders - which include Manukau City Council, 10.05 percent, Auckland City Council, New  Zealand Superannuation Fund and infrastructure investor Infratil. All have indicated they are unlikely to sell their holdings. Auckland Airport Chief Executive Don Huse said the outlook remains positive, helped by airlines making commitments to add capacity on key routes. ""Passenger growth is returning to the long-term trend. The outlook for the airlines is certainly positive and they are making commitments to new capacity,"" Huse told a media briefing. Huse expects revenue improvements across the business in the current  fiscal year, with growth in retail, car park, rental property as well as passenger numbers and aeronautical income.

Ltd. said Thursday it posted an annual net profit of 92 million New Zealand dollars (US{dollar}65 million; ?48 million) - an 11 percent fall from NZ{dollar}103.2  million (US{dollar}73 million; ?54 million) a year earlier.Profit was hurt by a NZ{dollar}9.9 million (US{dollar}7 million; ?5.2 million) provision for its long-term incentive schemes for senior management and  staff due to a significant rise in the company's share price.Auckland Airport remains positive about its outlook, predicting operating profit and revenue growth of 7 percent in fiscal 2008.Earnings growth at the airport has slowed over the past two years on  softening passenger volumes, and due to high capital expenditure linked  to an expansion of key services.The outlook for the airlines is certainly positive and they are making commitments to new capacity,"" Huse told a media briefing.

",5,"New Zealand airport operator Auckland International Airport Ltd. said Thursday it posted an annual net profit of 92 million New Zealand dollars (US{dollar}65 million; ?48 million) - an 11 percent fall from NZ{dollar}103.2  million (US{dollar}73 million; ?54 million) a year earlier.Profit was hurt by a NZ{dollar}9.9 million (US{dollar}7 million; ?5.2 million) provision for its long-term incentive schemes for senior management and  staff due to a significant rise in the company's share price.Auckland Airport remains positive about its outlook, predicting operating profit and revenue growth of 7 percent in fiscal 2008.Earnings growth at the airport has slowed over the past two years on  softening passenger volumes, and due to high capital expenditure linked  to an expansion of key services.The outlook for the airlines is certainly positive and they are making commitments to new capacity,"" Huse told a media briefing.

Unusually, the Xinjiang government has yet to make an announcement about Monday's violence or publish a death toll. Calls to the Xinjiang and Kashgar information offices rang unanswered. In a separate development, prosecutors in Xinjiang announced that they had formally charged the Uighur intellectual Ilham Tohti with separatism, meaning that he will soon face trial.

                  ",0,"Security tightened drastically across China's far western city of Kashgar on Wednesday, as the Uighur community disputed official reports blaming separatists for violence that claimed dozens of lives in the same part of the Xinjiang region on Monday.Residents and travellers said that extra security officials poured into the city , roads were closed and internet access cut, as Reuters reported a possible stabbing death.A French traveller told the news agency he saw a body lying in a pool of blood outside the Id Kah mosque in Kashgar on Wednesday morning, and two people with knives running away, but could not tell the cause of the violence.He also described a long convoy of armed police vehicles, including at least five armoured personnel carriers, driving into the city while other cars were turned away.Several hotel staff and a Kashgar resident said some or all roads into the city had been closed or heavily restricted and internet access shut off.

75,"“I’m not wearing this to make a political statement, I want to show my face,” says a masked man, from Hong Kong, now standing beneath the sandstone of the University of Queensland’s great court. “But even in Australia now we cannot be seen here at a protest. We are not out of sight of China’s government. They have made that clear.” Last week, the Brisbane campus of the 110-year-old university became a flashpoint for the ongoing international backlash against the Chinese state, its influence on Hong Kong and its mass detention of its Muslim Uighur population. A protest last Wednesday, organised by Hong Kong international students against the controversial extradition law, turned violent. Pro-Chinese government students interrupted the sit-in, tearing down banners, punching and shoving. But it’s the fallout from that protest, the quiet intimidation that followed – death threats, surveillance – that has many Hong Kong students, particularly those with family connections to mainland China, scared to show their faces. Attendees, who believe they were identified by videos of the protest, were subsequently targeted online in doxxing attacks; in one case a Hong Kong student had his driver’s licence, marriage certificate, student ID and other identifying information published on Chinese social media site Weibo. On Wednesday this week, a second protest was held. Smaller, more focused on the university’s links to China, and organised by Australian students, there was an undercurrent of fear among those who – unlike their domestic counterparts – were most vulnerable to the state’s capacity for retaliation. A masked woman, who did not give her name, addressed the crowd. She said she was from Hong Kong and feared for the safety of her family. “All in all, we are just protesters forced by an authoritarian government to protect ourselves,” she said, her voice trembling and then booming into the microphone. “Some protestors whose identities are disclosed will be stopped by police at the Hong Kong airport. So why am I now hiding my identity? Because I don’t want to be disappeared after showing up on this stage.” Why UQ? As the situation in Hong Kong becomes more fraught, unrest continues and fears grow that the Chinese military might intervene, the sprawling riverfront campus of the University of Queensland is an unlikely focal point for questions about China’s actions and its influence. But the punches thrown last Wednesday have placed the university, and its links to China, in the spotlight. Last Friday, the South China Morning Post revealed that the Brisbane Chinese consul-general, Xu Jie, who had praised the “patriotic behaviour” of the violent counter-protest, had been made an adjunct professor of language and culture by the university on 15 July. The debate over foreign influence at universities is not new, and not limited to China. It has been previously reported that some Chinese international students studying in Australia are monitored by the state and punished back home. Recently, the focus has turned to the presence of Confucius Institutes, government-sponsored organisations that are hosted by universities and promote Chinese culture and teach Mandarin. A recent legislative change means universities with the centres must now register them as potential sources of foreign influence. This also affects groups such as the United States Studies Centre, at the University of Sydney, which is part-funded by a US-based group that aims to strengthen the Australia-US relations

international backlash against the Chinese state, its influence on Hong Kong and its mass detention of its Muslim Uighur population.But it’s the fallout from that protest, the quiet intimidation that followed – death threats, surveillance – that has many Hong Kong students, particularly those with family connections to mainland China, scared to show their faces.The debate over foreign influence at universities is not new, and not limited to China.

76,"Sony is to shutter its ebook Reader Store in Europe and Australia following a similar pullout in North America, the company has said, as the once-mighty electronics giant pulls in its horns. The move comes on the heels of the sale of its struggling PC business and as  Sony looks to plug gaping holes in its balance sheet. Users of the company's tablets and smartphones will be transferred by next month to the Kobo e-book system operated by Tokyo-based online mall Rakuten, the company said in a statement issued Thursday. Reader Store will shut down on June 16 in Europe and Australia, while it will continue operating in Japan, it said. The Japanese electronics giant has already closed its Reader Store in North America in March. The streamlining came only a few month after the struggling manufacturer, which is a small player in the global personal computer market, sold its Vaio-brand PC division to a Japanese investment fund. Last week Sony warned it would report a bigger-than-expected annual losses, blaming costs tied to its exit from the personal computer business, as the once-high-flying firm undergoes a painful restructuring. The one-time byword for consumer electronics innovation warned it would book  a 130 billion yen net loss ($1.28 billion) in the latest fiscal year to March, while it slashed its operating earnings outlook.

        ",1,"Beijing’s unprecedented eviction of two pro-independence activists from Hong Kong’s parliament has dealt a severe blow to “political extremists”, a Communist party-controlled newspaper has claimed as members of the city’s legal community prepared to take to the streets in protest.One day after Beijing effectively barred Sixtus ‘Baggio’ Leung and Yau Wai-ching from taking up their seats in the former colony’s 70-seat legislative council, an editorial in the Global Times praised their ousting, arguing that the appeasement of such voices would plunge the financial hub into confusion and ruin.The Communist party’s official mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, said Beijing was taking decisive action against an intolerable and unrepentant collection of pro-independence “elements” who posed a direct threat to China’s sovereignty and national unity.“The central government will not hesitate to take effective measures to crack down on and curb the “Hong Kong independence” [movement],” it said.Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post echoed those views, describing the intervention, which came in the form of a highly unusual interpretation of the former colony’s mini-constitution, as a “strong tool to stamp out pro-independence forces”.

",5,"Beijing’s unprecedented eviction of two pro-independence activists from Hong Kong’s parliament has dealt a severe blow to “political extremists”, a Communist party-controlled newspaper has claimed as members of the city’s legal community prepared to take to the streets in protest.One day after Beijing effectively barred Sixtus ‘Baggio’ Leung and Yau Wai-ching from taking up their seats in the former colony’s 70-seat legislative council, an editorial in the Global Times praised their ousting, arguing that the appeasement of such voices would plunge the financial hub into confusion and ruin.The Communist party’s official mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, said Beijing was taking decisive action against an intolerable and unrepentant collection of pro-independence “elements” who posed a direct threat to China’s sovereignty and national unity.“The central government will not hesitate to take effective measures to crack down on and curb the “Hong Kong independence” [movement],” it said.Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post echoed those views, describing the intervention, which came in the form of a highly unusual interpretation of the former colony’s mini-constitution, as a “strong tool to stamp out pro-independence forces”.

79,"Thousands of mourners marched through the heart of Hong Kong in a candlelight vigil for Chinese Nobel peace prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, sending a powerful message to Beijing as it tries to erase his legacy. Liu died on Thursday at the age of 61, less than a month after he was diagnosed with liver cancer, and his ashes were scattered in the sea in a highly scripted ceremony tightly controlled by the Chinese government. The Hong Kong rally is the only large-scale commemoration for Liu on Chinese soil. The semi-autonomous city maintains a wide range of freedoms that are non-existent in mainland China, and several newspapers in the city splashed Liu’s portrait on their front pages. Besides mourning Liu, many called for the release of his wife Liu Xia, who despite never being accused of a crime has been kept under house arrest since her husband won the Nobel peace prize in 2010. At the front of the march was Lee Cheuk-yan, a former lawmaker of 20 years, carrying a banner calling for Liu’s spirit to inspire people. The four white Chinese characters painted on a black cloth was a replica of a banner hoisted by student protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989, an event that Liu flew back to China to join. “We’re here to tell [Chinese president] Xi Jinping that Hong Kong people will continue to fight in the spirit of Liu Xiaobo,” Lee said. “The way the funeral was controlled by the Communist party, it’s very sad to say that Liu Xiaobo cannot be free even in death. But now we must free Liu Xia, because she has already suffered so much.” In China, many do not even know Liu’s name, the result of a massive government censorship campaign that has scrubbed nearly all messages of support from Chinese websites and so

laureate Liu Xiaobo, sending a powerful message to Beijing as it tries to erase his legacy.Liu died on Thursday at the age of 61, less than a month after he was diagnosed with liver cancer, and his ashes were scattered in the sea in a highly scripted ceremony tightly controlled by the Chinese government.The Hong Kong rally is the only large-scale commemoration for Liu on Chinese soil.The semi-autonomous city maintains a wide range of freedoms that are non-existent in mainland China, and several newspapers in the city splashed Liu’s portrait on their front pages.Besides mourning Liu, many called for the release of his wife Liu Xia, who despite never being accused of a crime has been kept under house arrest since her husband won the Nobel peace prize in 2010.

",5,"Thousands of mourners marched through the heart of Hong Kong in a candlelight vigil for Chinese Nobel peace prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, sending a powerful message to Beijing as it tries to erase his legacy.Liu died on Thursday at the age of 61, less than a month after he was diagnosed with liver cancer, and his ashes were scattered in the sea in a highly scripted ceremony tightly controlled by the Chinese government.The Hong Kong rally is the only large-scale commemoration for Liu on Chinese soil.The semi-autonomous city maintains a wide range of freedoms that are non-existent in mainland China, and several newspapers in the city splashed Liu’s portrait on their front pages.Besides mourning Liu, many called for the release of his wife Liu Xia, who despite never being accused of a crime has been kept under house arrest since her husband won the Nobel peace prize in 2010.

80,"The euro briefly dropped to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar since last August on Wednesday amid a lingering malaise about Europe's economic and political future. The 12-nation euro bought as little as US{dollar}1.2018 - the lowest level since Aug. 30, when it bought US{dollar}1.1987. By midday it was back up to US{dollar}1.2051, slightly above the US{dollar}1.2047 it bought in New  York late Tuesday. The British pound rose to US{dollar}1.8091 from to US{dollar}1.8075. The dollar was up slightly against the Japanese yen, at 109.36 yen from  109.32 yen. Analysts said the euro's lethargy was part of concern about the European Union's political future ahead of a key summit Thursday and Friday. ""There's a lingering gloom in Europe,"" said Lee Ferridge, chief currency strategist at London's Rabobank. ""The 'no' votes against the constitution, will the ECB cut interest rates - it's all lingering."" Members of the 25-nation bloc at are loggerheads over the budget, coming on the heels of 'no' votes to the constitution by France and the Netherlands. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso warned that failing to overcome the deadlock over the EU's constitution could leave the bloc facing ""permanent crisis and paralysis."" Markets also were looking ahead to U.S. reports on inflation, security flows and industrial production coming this week. The dollar had opened weaker against other major currencies on recent days' mixed U.S. economic data. On Tuesday, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that retail sales fell by 0.5 percent in May, the first decline in nine months.  The U.S. Labor Department said wholesale prices fell by 0.6 percent  in May, the biggest decline in more than two years. That compared to hefty increases in March and April, which raised worries that inflation was threatening to break out of the moderate pattern of the past several years - something that would boost the prospects of U.S. interest rates rising further, and in turn likely lift the dollar.

81,"The Telegraph Media Group’s response to Peter Oborne’s bombshell of an article about pandering to HSBC was to “refute” it as “full of inaccuracy and innuendo”. It would say that, wouldn’t it? But what is the truth of his allegations about editorial being compromised by TMG’s desire to placate advertisers? If the Telegraph wants to be believed, it has to address each one, not with a blanket denial, but with a specific explanation. To assist the publisher, here’s the list of Oborne’s claims, and a set of relevant questions in every instance: Allegation 1: Oborne wrote an article last year about HSBC sending letters to British Muslims saying their accounts had been closed. It was not published. When he asked why, he was told there was “a bit of an issue” with HSBC. Questions to TMG: Was Oborne’s article turned down? If so, why was that article - later published here on the OpenDemocracy website - rejected? Allegation 2: In January 2014, the Telegraph’s then banking correspondent, Harry Wilson, wrote an article citing an analyst’s report claiming there was a “black hole” in HSBC’s accounts. It was later taken down from the paper’s website. Questions to TMG: Why was Wilson’s story removed? Did HSBC, or its lawyers, complain about the article? If there were legal problems with the piece, why was Wilson not consulted about them? Allegation 3: On 4 November 2014, several newspapers prominently reported a blow to HSBC profits when the bank set aside more than £1bn for customer compensation and an investigation into the rigging of currency markets. The Telegraph downplayed the story by giving it just five paragraphs on page 5 of the business section. Questions to TMG: Why was such a significant story given so little coverage? Was any editorial executive ordered to give it short shrift? Allegation 4: On 10 May 2014, the Telegraph carried a lengthy fe

Oborne’s claims, and a set of relevant questions in every instance: Allegation 1: Oborne wrote an article last year about HSBC sending letters to British Muslims saying their accounts had been

82,"(GRAPHIC) An explosion at a coal mine in northern China killed 40 people Thursday and trapped another 74 underground, officials said, in the latest tragedy to strike the notoriously unsafe industry. The gas blast happened just after midnight at a mine in Linfen city,  a big coal mining area in Shanxi province, the State Administration of Mine Safety said on its website. ""Thirteen miners have been rescued and sent to the hospital for emergency treatment, 40 have been found dead and 74 are trapped,"" the statement said. No reasons were given for why the explosion at the Ruizhiyuan mine occurred but the administration said an investigation had been launched  even as rescue operations were underway. ""We must immediately organise the police force, place the mine boss and other people responsible under detention, seal the mine offices and  freeze its bank accounts,"" the statement said. China's coal mines are among the most dangerous in the world, with safety standards often ignored in the quest for profits and the drive to meet the nation's booming energy demands. The central government has previously spoken out against endemic corruption in the coal mining industry, with a particular concern the collusion between local government officials and businessmen. More than 4,700 coal miners died in China last year, according to official figures -- a fatality rate of nearly 13 a day. Independent labour groups put the real toll at closer to 20,000 annually, saying many accidents are covered up. The mine safety administration said the Ruizhiyuan mine had a license to produce 210,000 tonnes of coal a year, but no details were given as to whether that output was being exceeded, as is often the case. One local farmer said residents were being kept from approaching the  mine. ""The mine is locked down by all kinds of departments, including the police, no one can get near,"" said the farmer, who refused to identify himself after being contacted by AFP by phone. Meanwhile, the official Xinhua news agency reported that at least 11  workers were missing after the entrance to an illegal iron and gold mine well collapsed in neighbouring Hebei province. The accident in Chengde city occurred on Monday, the report said, while not explaining why it was only reported on Thursday. In the worst reported coal accident this year, 172 miners were killed in August when their mine in eastern China's Shandong province flooded after a nearby river burst its banks following heavy downpours. Another nine people died in a nearby mine in the same circumstances. Despite the bad weather, the accidents were largely blamed on bad management, state-media reports said at the time. Those tragedies were the worst reported coal mining disasters in China since an explosion at a colliery in the northeastern Liaoning province in 2005 claimed 214 lives.

and trapped another 74 underground, officials said, in the latest tragedy to strike the notoriously unsafe industry.The gas blast happened just after midnight at a mine in Linfen city,  a big coal mining area in Shanxi province, the State Administration of Mine Safety said on its website.No reasons were given for why the explosion at the Ruizhiyuan mine occurred but the administration said an investigation had been launched  even as rescue operations were underway.The mine safety administration said the Ruizhiyuan mine had a license to produce 210,000 tonnes of coal a year, but no details were given as to whether that output was being exceeded, as is often the case.In the worst reported coal accident this year, 172 miners were killed in August when their mine in eastern China's Shandong province flooded after a nearby river burst its banks following heavy downpours.

",5,"(GRAPHIC) An explosion at a coal mine in northern China killed 40 people Thursday and trapped another 74 underground, officials said, in the latest tragedy to strike the notoriously unsafe industry.The gas blast happened just after midnight at a mine in Linfen city,  a big coal mining area in Shanxi province, the State Administration of Mine Safety said on its website.No reasons were given for why the explosion at the Ruizhiyuan mine occurred but the administration said an investigation had been launched  even as rescue operations were underway.The mine safety administration said the Ruizhiyuan mine had a license to produce 210,000 tonnes of coal a year, but no details were given as to whether that output was being exceeded, as is often the case.In the worst reported coal accident this year, 172 miners were killed in August when their mine in eastern China's Shandong province flooded after a nearby river burst its banks following heavy downpours.

83,"Violent reaction in Vietnam to China's expansionist stance in disputed seas has turned deadly with reports that 20 or more people have been killed during rioting that began with attacks on foreign-owned factories. A top Taiwanese diplomat said rioters had stormed a large Taiwanese steel mill in Vietnam, killing at least one Chinese worker and injuring 90 more. Huang Chih-peng said the violence took place late on Wednesday and early Thursday at the Formosa steel mill in central Vietnam. A doctor at a hospital in the central Vietnamese province of Ha Tinh said five Vietnamese workers and 16 other people described as Chinese died during anti-China rioting on Wednesday night. ""There were about a hundred people sent to the hospital last night. Many were Chinese. More are being sent to the hospital this morning,"" the doctor told the Reuters news agency by phone. Cambodia said hundreds of Chinese nationals had poured across the border from Vietnam to escape the riots. ""Yesterday more than 600 Chinese people from Vietnam crossed at Bavet international checkpoint into Cambodia,"" Kirt Chantharith, a police spokesman, told the Reuters news agency. Bavet is on a highway stretching from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's commercial centre, to Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh.

84,"MOZAMBIQUE'S CONSTITUTION Differences over the treatment of former fighters have slowed the work of a commission charged with drafting amendments to Mozambique's constitution, its chairman said Saturday. A key sticking point in the work of the commission is the position of former foes from Mozambique's brutal civil war, the ruling FRELIMO party and the opposition RENAMO. FRELIMO - which stands for the Mozambique Liberation Movement - has ruled the southeastern African country since ousting Portuguese  colonial rulers in 1975. It wants its former fighters to be given preferential treatment, said Hermenegildo Gamito, commission chairman. It has submitted an amendment instructing the state ""to give special protection to those disabled during the national liberation  struggle, as well as the orphans and other dependents of those who died in this cause."" RENAMO - a Portuguese acronym for the Mozambican Resistance Movement -which waged a brutal 16-year civil war against FRELIMO, wants this ""special protection"" for its former combatants. It is also pushing for its military campaign, it calls ""the struggle for democracy"" to be given equal status to that of Frelimo's ""liberation struggle."" Mozambique emerged from the civil war in 1992. Lawmakers have urged the commission to speed up its work so that  a new constitution can be adopted by late 2004. The commission has also made little progress in designing a new flag and national emblem, Gamito said. The Commission also complained that its budget was insufficient,  and did not allow it to meet regularly in the intervals between parliamentary sittings. The socialist FRELIMO party has gradually converted to free market policies since 1994.

to Mozambique's constitution, its chairman said Saturday.A key sticking point in the work of the commission is the position of former foes from Mozambique's brutal civil war, the ruling FRELIMO party and the opposition RENAMO.It wants its former fighters to be given preferential treatment, said Hermenegildo Gamito, commission chairman.RENAMO - a Portuguese acronym for the Mozambican Resistance Movement -which waged a brutal 16-year civil war against FRELIMO, wants this ""special protection"" for its former combatants.It is also pushing for its military campaign, it calls ""the struggle for democracy"" to be given equal status to that of Frelimo's ""liberation struggle.""

",5,"MOZAMBIQUE'S CONSTITUTION Differences over the treatment of former fighters have slowed the work of a commission charged with drafting amendments to Mozambique's constitution, its chairman said Saturday.A key sticking point in the work of the commission is the position of former foes from Mozambique's brutal civil war, the ruling FRELIMO party and the opposition RENAMO.It wants its former fighters to be given preferential treatment, said Hermenegildo Gamito, commission chairman.RENAMO - a Portuguese acronym for the Mozambican Resistance Movement -which waged a brutal 16-year civil war against FRELIMO, wants this ""special protection"" for its former combatants.It is also pushing for its military campaign, it calls ""the struggle for democracy"" to be given equal status to that of Frelimo's ""liberation struggle.""

85,"Time for a quick summary: The flash eurozone PMIs for February suggested the bloc’s economy is close to stagnation, held back by a contracting manufacturing sector The FTSE 100 has been the worst performer compared with its European peers, and is currently down 67 points or 0.9% at 7,161 Centrica is topping the FTSE’s loser board today, with shares hitting a 16-year low after the parent company of British Gas reported a sharp fall in customers and warned profits this year would be hit by the energy price cap There was a big upside surprise in the UK public finances figures for January, which showed a record monthly surplus of £14.9bn, in a gift to chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of his spring statement on 13 March US weekly jobless claims fell last week, but there was disappointing data on durable goods, which indicated a slowdown in the amount being spent by firms Meanwhile the US flash PMI’s for February showed that growth in services ticked up, offsetting slowing growth in manufacturing Wall Street opened lower, and losses have since widened On that note it’s time to close up for the day. Thank you for all the comments, and please join us again tomorrow. AM Some more upbeat US data just out, as a pick-up in services growth in February offset slowing growth in the manufacturing sector. Here are the headline numbers in the IHS Markit PMIs, where anything above 50 signals growth: Services: 56.2 in Feb (54.2 in Jan) Manufacturing: 53.7 in Feb (54.9 in Jan) Combined: 55.8 in Feb (54.4 in Jan) Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit, provides some context for the numbers: February data provides a positive signal for first quarter economic growth, with US businesses reporting the fastest output expansion since the middle of 2018. Service sector firms led the way, supported by solid improvements in business and consumer spending. Private sector payroll numbers increased to the greatest extent for five months, which adds to hopes that robust domestic demand will act as a growth tailwind over the near-term. Historical comparisons suggest the latest survey data are indicative of an underlying economic growth rate of around 2.5% annualised, although the PMI is designed to monitor private sector companies so the impact of the government shutdown may not be fully captured. The opening bell has rung on Wall Street and US markets edged lower, reflecting some disappointing economic data: Dow Jones: -0.1% at 25,918 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,779 Nasdaq: -0.2% at 7,475 Investors are digesting some gloomier US economic data, after new orders for key, American-made capital goods fell unexpectedly in December. The figures suggested business spending on machinery and metals is slowing, with orders for non-defence goods excluding aircraft down 0.7%, following a 1% fall in January. Andrew Hunter, senior US Economist at Capital Economics sums it up nicely: The December durables goods data suggest that equipment investment growth slowed further in the fourth quarter, and we expect it to remain weak for most of this year. As we await the opening bell on Wall Street - with US markets expected to open roughly flat - it’s time for a recap of how it’s looking across Europe.

However they were still down 28%, at 118p, cutting the company’s market value by £140m. The fall is bad news for Woodford Investment Management, led by the City investment guru Neil Woodford, which is the largest shareholder in the company, with a stake of about 27%.

87,"Obama vows to retaliate against  Russia, as White House directly accuses Putin of role in election hacking

Trump tries to stop ZTE repeal in urgent meeting with lawmakers

US President Barack Obama has vowed to retaliate against Russia after the White House on Thursday pointed to Vladimir Putin’s direct involvement in cyber attacks designed to sway the US election, dramatically upping the stakes in a dispute between the world’s leading nuclear powers.
Publicly accusing Russian President Putin puts the White House under even greater pressure to respond forcefully to interference that may have played a role in a tight November election between Republican president-elect Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Hillary Clinton told donors that the hacks were partially to blame for her loss to President-elect Donald Trump. At a fund-raising event in New York Thursday night Clinton said that the Russians had sought to “undermine our democracy” through the cyberattacks, which she believed were a result of Putin’s “personal beef” against her.
 
“Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people, and that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election,” the Democrat said, according to a recording of the event obtained by the New York Times. She also said that FBI director James Comey’s October 28 letter disclosing a new investigation of e-mails from her time as secretary of state damaged her with swing-state voters days before the election. The two factors were “unprecedented,” Clinton said.

7:55am Trump tries to stop ZTE repeal in urgent meeting with lawmakers 21 Jun 2018 US President Barack Obama has vowed to retaliate against Russia after the White House on Thursday pointed to Vladimir Putin’s direct involvement in cyber attacks designed to sway the US election, dramatically upping the stakes in a dispute between the world’s leading nuclear powers.Publicly accusing Russian President Putin puts the White House under even greater pressure to respond forcefully to interference that may have played a role in a tight November election between Republican president-elect Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton.At a fund-raising event in New York Thursday night Clinton said that the Russians had sought to “undermine our democracy” through the cyberattacks, which she believed were a result of Putin’s “personal beef” against her.“Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people, and that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election,” the Democrat said, according to a recording of the event obtained by the New York Times.There is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action ... at a time and place of our own choosing President Barack Obama Obama said on Thursday the United States will retaliate against the Russian hacking.

meeting with lawmakers 21 Jun 2018 US President Barack Obama has vowed to retaliate against Russia after the White House on Thursday pointed to Vladimir Putin’s direct involvement in cyber attacks designed to sway the US election, dramatically upping the stakes in a dispute between the world’s leading nuclear powers.Publicly accusing Russian President Putin puts the White House under even greater pressure to respond forcefully to interference that may have played a role in a tight November election between Republican president-elect Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton.At a fund-raising event in New York Thursday night Clinton said that the Russians had sought to “undermine our democracy” through the cyberattacks, which she believed were a result of Putin’s “personal beef” against her.“Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people, and that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election,” the Democrat said, according to a recording of the event obtained by the New York Times.There is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action ... at a time and place of our own choosing President Barack Obama Obama said on Thursday the United States will retaliate against the Russian hacking.

88,"The Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) must examine whether a patient's right to confidentiality at all costs is serving South Africa well in its war on Aids, the Democratic Alliance said on Thursday. The DA was reacting to an investigation of alleged unprofessional conduct by a Bloemfontein pathologist who put ""Aids""  on a death certificate as a cause of death of a young woman. ""It is important that this hearing be conducted, because the Council has often faced complaints that it is simply there to protect doctors,"" DA spokesman on health, Gareth Morgan, said. ""The outcome will be very important for South Africa, because it  will force us to at last confront the conflict between confidentiality and awareness that we have been tiptoeing around since the epidemic began,"" he said in a statement. Morgan said in the process of conducting this disciplinary hearing, the party hoped that those involved would consider that current policies that protected the confidentiality of Aids patients at all costs may not be helping the national Aids awareness campaign. He said in the light of new vigour in the war on Aids, after ""the effective demotion of the Health Minister,"" and the long-awaited availability of effective treatment, it might be necessary to re-examine confidentiality policies and adapt them slightly. Morgan said the disclosure of an unknown HIV infection to family  members of a dead patient will inevitably come as a shock. ""But it is possible to argue that it is better that they should know of the possible infection risk they face, and therefore be able to be tested and if necessary receive treatment, than remain uninformed."" Morgan said possibly doctors should be given the leeway to use their judgement, on the basis of certain guidelines, about how to describe the cause of death.

whether a patient's right to confidentiality at all costs is serving South Africa well in its war on Aids, the Democratic Alliance said on Thursday.The DA was reacting to an investigation of alleged unprofessional conduct by a Bloemfontein pathologist who put ""Aids""  on a death certificate as a cause of death of a young woman.""It is important that this hearing be conducted, because the Council has often faced complaints that it is simply there to protect doctors,"" DA spokesman on health, Gareth Morgan, said.""The outcome will be very important for South Africa, because it  will force us to at last confront the conflict between confidentiality and awareness that we have been tiptoeing around since the epidemic began,"" he said in a statement.""But it is possible to argue that it is better that they should know of the possible infection risk they face, and therefore be able to be tested and if necessary receive treatment, than remain uninformed.""

",5,"The Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) must examine whether a patient's right to confidentiality at all costs is serving South Africa well in its war on Aids, the Democratic Alliance said on Thursday.The DA was reacting to an investigation of alleged unprofessional conduct by a Bloemfontein pathologist who put ""Aids""  on a death certificate as a cause of death of a young woman.""It is important that this hearing be conducted, because the Council has often faced complaints that it is simply there to protect doctors,"" DA spokesman on health, Gareth Morgan, said.""The outcome will be very important for South Africa, because it  will force us to at last confront the conflict between confidentiality and awareness that we have been tiptoeing around since the epidemic began,"" he said in a statement.""But it is possible to argue that it is better that they should know of the possible infection risk they face, and therefore be able to be tested and if necessary receive treatment, than remain uninformed.""

89,"Update 1 - Steinhoff board and management don't know how accounting scandal happened Chantall Presence PARLIAMENT, January 31 (ANA) - Steinhoff board and management members were on Wednesday unable to answer questions from MPs on exactly what led to the accounting scandal which saw the international company's share price drop by more than eighty percent. ""Until we have those reports, not only from statutory auditors, but from the forensic investigations, we really do not know how this has happened,"" said Christo Wiese, the former supervisory board chairman and one of the biggest shareholders of the retailer. Wiese, along with a large contingent of board and management, was briefing three parliamentary committees. Acting board chairwoman Heather Sonn told MPs they were constrained legally in what they could say in public, but revealed that the company had reported the former chief executive Markus Jooste to the Directorate for Priority Investigation, more commonly known as the Hawks in South Africa. Jooste resigned shortly after news broke of the scandal. Wiese said he became aware of the accounting irregularities days before it was confirmed in early December. He was at pains to point out that the auditors who pointed out the irregularities in the 2017 financial statements had been the same company ""paid handsomely"" to do previous audits, the integrity of which are also now been questioned. Chairman of the supervisory board's audit committee Steve Booysen said, while initial reports of fraud at Steinhoff being investigated by German authorities surfaced in September last year, irregularities were only confirmed in December. Jooste was asked to make a presentation to explain certain transactions and ""more importantly the cash flow of certain transactions"", said Booysen. ""Markus Jooste then did send an sms text message to me as audit chairman and the content of the sms really led me to the conclusion that that is confirmation of the accounting irregularities and then he later offered that evening to make his presentation for which he didn't pitch up..."" Booysen said Jooste tendered his resignation at 19h45 that same evening. The Steinhoff team said it was due to meet with PriceWaterhouseCoopers who were appointed to do the independent probe into the debacle this week. - African News Agency (ANA), Editing by Catherine Rice

Priority Investigation, more commonly known as the Hawks in South Africa.Jooste resigned shortly after news broke of the scandal.Chairman of the supervisory board's audit committee Steve Booysen said,

board chairman and one of the biggest shareholders of the retailer.Wiese, along with a large contingent of board and management, was briefing three parliamentary committees.Acting board chairwoman Heather Sonn told MPs they were constrained legally in what they could say in public, but revealed that the company had reported the former chief executive Markus Jooste to the Directorate for Priority Investigation, more commonly known as the Hawks in South Africa.Jooste resigned shortly after news broke of the scandal.Chairman of the supervisory board's audit committee Steve Booysen said,

The search in Kowloon followed the leak of documents that revealed donations made by the tycoon, Jimmy Lai, to pro-democracy individuals and organisations, and strange incidents including a faked obituary for him. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said it had acted after receiving complaints alleging that legislators had accepted bribes and denied that political considerations played a part. Lai's aide, Mark Simon, whose home was also searched, told the Associated Press that the visits were ""a wonderful diversion two days, three days, before [something that is] not going to be very popular is announced"".

Activists have responded by vowing to start on Sunday, rather than any time later, their non-violent campaign of civil disobedience, called Occupy Central With Love and Peace. Last month, a fake obituary for Lai, saying he had died of Aids and cancer, appeared in a rival Hong Kong publication.

",5,"Anti-corruption officers in Hong Kong searched the home of a media tycoon and outspoken critic of Beijing early Thursday morning, as the battle over electoral changes stepped up.The search in Kowloon followed the leak of documents that revealed donations made by the tycoon, Jimmy Lai, to pro-democracy individuals and organisations, and strange incidents including a faked obituary for him.The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said it had acted after receiving complaints alleging that legislators had accepted bribes and denied that political considerations played a part.Lai's aide, Mark Simon, whose home was also searched, told the Associated Press that the visits were ""a wonderful diversion two days, three days, before [something that is] not going to be very popular is announced"".Beijing is due to announce plans for electoral reforms this weekend.

91,"There’s a moment in Jack Livings’ The Dog, his debut collection of stories set in contemporary China, when a character named Yang sits in front of his television watching footage of the aftermath of an earthquake. The screen shows a woman “covered in grey dust, clawing at chunks of concrete”, digging to try to find her child. Yang resolves to look away. He “cough[s] down the ache in his throat”. But a cliche in the TV commentary begins to niggle at him: “A scene of unimaginable destruction, the newscaster said, and Yang thought, It’s not unimaginable.” The Dog is, among other things, a forceful argument for the role of imagination in fiction and in life. These short stories successfully put us into other people’s shoes, extending a gift of empathy. Livings is particularly good at exploring occasions when a character’s orderly world is disrupted by outside forces: a natural disaster; a theft; a brutal police beating. In “The Pocketbook”, a young expat student has her ID card stolen and thereby becomes the unlikely focus of a political protest. In “The Heir”, an Uighur gangster’s carefully cultivated indifference to the Chinese police is tested to its limit when his grandson is arrested. These accounts of unsettled lives can be sorrowful, but they are also often funny.

92,"Strong winds, severe rain and flooding around Gauteng have left people on the East Rand homeless and have even brought Johannesburg's art scene to a halt. Ekurhuleni disaster management said on Friday that more than 70 shacks were rebuilt in Vumimuzi, Tembisa on the East Rand after strong winds destroyed them. Acting director Anthony Kesten said in a statement that 140 shacks were blown down during a storm on Thursday. ""Work continues on site until late today. For the people whose shacks will not be finished today, we will put them into a tent for overnight accommodation,"" he said. The Market Theatre Laboratory announced on Friday that all Arts Alive Festival shows scheduled for the weekend had been cancelled. ""Because of the severe rain, flooding has occurred in the venue. It was deemed necessary to close the lab to the public until the requisite safety inspections have been conducted,"" the theatre said in a statement. ""We wish the participants in the festival all the best for the weekend and hope to host them again in future."" The SA Weather Service said on Friday that more rainfall and cold weather was expected in parts of the country. Spokeswoman Kenosi Machepa said heavy rainfalls were expected over the northern parts of KwaZulu-Natal, the eastern Highveld and escarpment of Mpumalanga, and the central parts of Limpopo on Friday. ""Temperatures will still be cool to warm over most parts of the country, but  otherwise cold over Gauteng and Mpumalanga."" Machepa said the wet weather was expected to clear completely by Saturday morning in the eastern parts of the country. Temperatures were expected to start rising from Saturday. ""A weak cold front is approaching from the west and will result in isolated showers and rain in the south-western parts of the country by Sunday."" On Friday two cars were swept off a small flooded bridge on Valley Drive, Waterfall, in KwaZulu-Natal. ER24 spokesman Derrick Banks said the drivers of the two vehicles were found  safely on the side of the road. ""They were unharmed and just wet and cold. They would go and see their own doctor if they needed further medical assistance."" He advised motorists not to drive through flooded areas.

94,"Big Blue hits the G-spot with low-priced laptops
PUBLISHED : Tuesday, 06 May, 2003, 12:00am
Cheap is a word rarely associated with IBM ThinkPads, which are the favourite choice of enterprises with generous information technology budgets.
But in the past two years, Big Blue has reduced its prices to fend off the likes of Dell and Acer, which are making good, sturdy machines with smaller price-tags.
IBM's latest, the G-series ThinkPads, have an attractive starting price of HK$7,788.
IBM built the G-series with a particular set of customers in mind - those who are willing to compromise on some things such as weight and battery life, for raw speed and performance at a low price. The new G-series machines are meant to offer mobility, but perform like desktop computers.
A G-series machine is no lightweight, at 3.45kg. Running Intel's Pentium 4 processor with a top speed of three gigahertz, it will give performance equivalent to desktop PCs.
Pitched as a desktop equivalent, it comes with a floppy drive, which is probably unnecessary these days, a CD-Rom drive and two USB ports. Most desktop PCs have at least four USB ports.
Like the Sony Vaio PCG-Z1P, the G-series is also shaped like a wedge to make the keyboard feel like that of a desktop PC.
Some G-series models come with Intel Centrino mobile technology and carry a premium price. The greater power-efficiency of this technology means that batteries are supposed to last about 3 hours between charges.

making good, sturdy machines with smaller price-tags.IBM's latest, the G-series ThinkPads, have an attractive starting price of HK$7,788.IBM built the G-series with a particular set of customers in mind - those who are willing to compromise on some things such as weight and battery life, for raw speed and performance at a low price.Pitched as a desktop equivalent, it comes with a floppy drive, which is probably unnecessary these days, a CD-Rom drive and two USB ports.Like the Sony Vaio PCG-Z1P, the G-series is also shaped like a wedge to make the keyboard feel like that of a desktop PC.

",5,"But in the past two years, Big Blue has reduced its prices to fend off the likes of Dell and Acer, which are making good, sturdy machines with smaller price-tags.IBM's latest, the G-series ThinkPads, have an attractive starting price of HK$7,788.IBM built the G-series with a particular set of customers in mind - those who are willing to compromise on some things such as weight and battery life, for raw speed and performance at a low price.Pitched as a desktop equivalent, it comes with a floppy drive, which is probably unnecessary these days, a CD-Rom drive and two USB ports.Like the Sony Vaio PCG-Z1P, the G-series is also shaped like a wedge to make the keyboard feel like that of a desktop PC.

95,"A moderate Uighur intellectual, who was jailed for life after opposing China’s draconian policies in its violence-stricken west, has been named the winner of a prestigious award known as the “human rights Nobel” in a move likely to infuriate Beijing. Ilham Tohti, who has been called China’s Mandela, was announced as the winner of the annual Martin Ennals award for human rights defenders on Tuesday. The honour comes two years after the 46-year-old scholar was convicted of separatism and condemned to a life behind bars by a court in Xinjiang, a vast region of western China where there have been repeated outbreaks of ethnic unrest and violence. In a statement, the Martin Ennals foundation said Ilham Tohti had spent two decades trying “to foster dialogue and understanding” between China’s Han majority and members of Xinjiang’s largely Muslim Uighur ethnic minority, of which he is a member. “He has rejected separatism and violence, and sought reconciliation based on a respect for Uighur culture, which has been subject to religious, cultural and political repression,” it added. Beijing has painted Ilham Tohti – whom western governments and rights groups universally view as a voice of moderation – as a dangerous separatist and “scholar-turned-criminal” who preached “hatred and killing”. “His case has nothing to do with human rights,” Geng Shuang, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, told reporters on Tuesday, accusing the scholar of promoting and taking part in separatist activities. But Dick Oosting, the chair of the Martin Ennals foundation, rejected that depiction and accused Beijing of silencing a peaceful advocate of Uighur rights. “The real shame of this situation is that by eliminating the moderate voice of Ilham Tohti the Chinese government is in fact laying the groundwork for the very extremism it says it wants to prevent.” Teng Biao, an exiled human rights lawyer and friend of the jailed scholar, welcomed the award. “It is definitely good news,” he said. “It won’t necessarily lead to an early release

winner of a prestigious award known as the “human rights Nobel” in a move likely to infuriate Beijing.Ilham Tohti, who has been called China’s Mandela, was announced as the winner of the annual Martin Ennals award for human rights defenders on Tuesday.In a statement, the Martin Ennals foundation said Ilham Tohti had spent two decades trying “to foster dialogue and understanding” between China’s Han majority and members of Xinjiang’s largely Muslim Uighur ethnic minority, of which he is a member.“He has rejected separatism and violence, and sought reconciliation based on a respect for Uighur culture, which has been subject to religious, cultural and political repression,” it added.“His case has nothing to do with human rights,” Geng Shuang, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, told reporters on Tuesday, accusing the scholar of promoting and taking part in separatist activities.

",5,"A moderate Uighur intellectual, who was jailed for life after opposing China’s draconian policies in its violence-stricken west, has been named the winner of a prestigious award known as the “human rights Nobel” in a move likely to infuriate Beijing.Ilham Tohti, who has been called China’s Mandela, was announced as the winner of the annual Martin Ennals award for human rights defenders on Tuesday.In a statement, the Martin Ennals foundation said Ilham Tohti had spent two decades trying “to foster dialogue and understanding” between China’s Han majority and members of Xinjiang’s largely Muslim Uighur ethnic minority, of which he is a member.“He has rejected separatism and violence, and sought reconciliation based on a respect for Uighur culture, which has been subject to religious,

96,"The Democratic Alliance would visit Mothutlung, near Brits in the North
West, the party said on Sunday.
""DA parliamentary leader Lindiwe Mazibuko, provincial leader in the North
West Chris Hattingh and member of parliament Winston Rabotapi will be
conducting an oversight visit in Mothutlung on Monday,"" spokesman Siviwe
Gwarube said.
Residents of Mothutlung were without water for about two weeks.
During service delivery protests three people died.
Two protestors were shot dead, allegedly by police, on Monday during a
service delivery protest.
Another man died after he allegedly fell out of a moving Nyala police
armoured vehicle in a bid to escape.
""The DA delegation will be paying their respects to the families that have
lost loved ones, as well as inspecting the purification plant that the water
affairs minister, Edna Molewa, committed to fixing last week Friday,"" Gwarube
said.
Colonel Sabata Mokgwabone said the protests ended on Thursday.
Water was restored in the area on Friday, the premier's spokesman Lesiba Kgwele 
said.
""Water has been restored in most parts of Mothutlung, the challenge is that
people are watering their gardens which is affecting the supply of water to
some areas,"" Kgwele said.
No violent incidents were reported in the area over the weekend, Mokgwabone
said on Sunday morning.

97,"Rail Enforcement Unit a success story, says Cape Town mayor Songezo Ndlendle CAPE TOWN, January 9 (ANA) - Cape Town Mayor, Dan Plato on Wednesday said the Rail Enforcement Unit (REU) -- which provides an additional 100 law enforcement officers to the existing security personnel in meeting Metrorail's security challenges -- has been a success story and will assist in stabilising the urban rail service over the next few months. ""The people of Cape Town deserve a safe and reliable public transport system. Rail should be commuters' mode of choice because commuting by rail is more affordable, and it's the most efficient mode of transport when operating optimally,"" said Plato. ""The REU's successes to date give me a good reason to believe that this unit will assist us in stabilising the urban rail service over the next few months. With less crime and vandalism, we can expect a decrease in delays and cancellations, and with that, we can expect more commuters opting for trains as opposed to road-based transport,"" he added. REU was launched by the national minister of transport in October last year, coinciding with transport month. The unit is jointly funded by the City of Cape Town, the Western Cape Government and the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa). The unit has recorded about 36 arrests on a range of charges including assault, possession of drugs and stolen property, malicious damage to property and theft, confiscations of 379,5 metres of cable and 800 kilograms of railway signal cable, among other successes, according to the Western Cape transport and public works. The REU has been a force multiplier for Prasa's Regional Protection Services Unit. Together, the teams have ensured greater operational visibility on trains and stations, searching more individuals during joint operations, confiscating a greater number of dangerous weapons and fraudulent train tickets. ""With enforcement success on track, the next priority should be closing down non-compliant scrap dealers and lobbying for legislative changes to permit only traceable electronic payment methods. The current practice of cash-for-copper-no-questions-asked encourages illegal and illicit scrap dealing,"" said Metrorail Western Cape regional manager, Richard Walker. Western Cape member of the executive council (MEC) for transport and public works and chairperson of the RMTT, Donald Grant said that they launched the initiative with the intention to increase security on our rail network as the situation had reached dire straits with arson, vandalism, cable theft, and violent crime becoming commonplace. ""An intervention was urgently required, and through effective intergovernmental cooperation we were able to get the REU off the ground,"" he said. ""The initial results and arrests are testaments to the initiative's effectiveness and our officers' commitment on the ground. Our Rail Management Task Team (RMTT) is continuing to explore ways in which to dramatically improve rail for the thousands of commuters who rely on this mode of transport."" - African News Agency

Cape Town Mayor, Dan Plato on Wednesday said the Rail Enforcement Unit (REU) -- which provides an additional 100 law enforcement officers to the existing security personnel in meeting Metrorail's security challenges -- has been a success story and will assist in stabilising the urban rail service over the next few months.With less crime and vandalism, we can expect a decrease in delays and cancellations, and with that, we can expect more commuters opting for trains as opposed to road-based transport,"" he added.The unit is jointly funded by the City of Cape Town, the Western Cape Government and the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa).Western Cape member of the executive council (MEC) for transport and public works and chairperson of the RMTT, Donald Grant said that they launched the initiative with the intention to increase security on our rail network as the situation had reached dire straits with arson, vandalism, cable theft, and violent crime becoming commonplace.Our Rail Management Task Team (RMTT) is continuing to explore ways in which to dramatically improve rail for the thousands of commuters who rely on this mode of transport.""

",5,"Rail Enforcement Unit a success story, says Cape Town mayor Songezo Ndlendle CAPE TOWN, January 9 (ANA) - Cape Town Mayor, Dan Plato on Wednesday said the Rail Enforcement Unit (REU) -- which provides an additional 100 law enforcement officers to the existing security personnel in meeting Metrorail's security challenges -- has been a success story and will assist in stabilising the urban rail service over the next few months.With less crime and vandalism, we can expect a decrease in delays and cancellations, and with that, we can expect more commuters opting for trains as opposed to road-based transport,"" he added.The unit is jointly funded by the City of Cape Town, the Western Cape Government and the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa).Western Cape member of the executive council (MEC) for transport and public works and chairperson of the RMTT, Donald Grant said that they launched the initiative with the intention to increase security on our rail network as the situation had reached dire straits with arson, vandalism, cable theft, and violent crime becoming commonplace.Our Rail Management Task Team (RMTT) is continuing to explore ways in which to dramatically improve rail for the thousands of commuters who rely on this mode of transport.""

You could almost be forgiven for labelling Karen Ramirez as just another house music vocalist. Her first hit, Looking For Love, a remake of the Everything But The Girl track, and the single Troubled Girl, have been remixed often enough to sound like house tracks. And she is signed on to club label Manifesto.
But with her soon-to-be-released debut Distant Dreams, Ramirez is letting listeners know she is much more than your standard dance diva.
'It's everything, there's a bit of jazz, soul, pop, Latin. It's interesting,' she said from London.
The album is already receiving rave reviews for being a distinctive fusion of various musical genres. Although initially concerned dance remixes would pigeonhole her, she appreciates they have contributed to her success.
'Sometimes I think, oh gosh, it's going too much in that direction, but then if people buy the album and listen to it they know that I'm not a club act.

'It's just a means of making it more commercial. I think that's a good thing really, as long as you can make it a bit more dancey without spoiling the song.'  Ramirez, who has been compared to the likes of Sade and Aretha Franklin, cites Massive Attack, Portishead and Joni Mitchell as musical influences. The North London-born, Trinidad-raised Croydon resident prides herself on being able to defy classification.

as just another house music vocalist.Her first hit, Looking For Love, a remake of the Everything But The Girl track, and the single Troubled Girl, have been remixed often enough to sound like house tracks.But with her soon-to-be-released debut Distant Dreams, Ramirez is letting listeners know she is much more than your standard dance diva.'It's everything, there's a bit of jazz, soul, pop, Latin.'Sometimes I think, oh gosh, it's going too much in that direction, but then if people buy the album and listen to it they know that I'm not a club act.

",5,"Making it where it counts PUBLISHED : Friday, 28 August, 1998, 12:00am You could almost be forgiven for labelling Karen Ramirez as just another house music vocalist.Her first hit, Looking For Love, a remake of the Everything But The Girl track, and the single Troubled Girl, have been remixed often enough to sound like house tracks.But with her soon-to-be-released debut Distant Dreams, Ramirez is letting listeners know she is much more than your standard dance diva.'It's everything, there's a bit of jazz, soul, pop, Latin.'Sometimes I think, oh gosh, it's going too much in that direction, but then if people buy the album and listen to it they know that I'm not a club act.

99,"US stock markets dropped dramatically on Friday afternoon, dragging overall global markets to their worst week of the year as concerns about the health of the Chinese economy rattled investors across the world. All of the main US indices closed down more than 3% on Friday, the fourth consecutive day of falls. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 531 points, or 3.1%, to 16,460 – the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.2% to 1,971 and the Nasdaq closed down 3.5% to 4,706. Most major markets around the world also suffered bruising losses as new data suggested Chinese factory activity had slowed to levels last seen in 2009 and added to investors’ fears about the country’s economy since Beijing devalued its currency last week. US oil prices also crashed down to below $40 a barrel a one point, a level not seen since the financial crisis. The dollar fell to a two-month low against the euro and added to speculation that the Federal Reserve may now not raise US interest rates next month, as had been widely expected by economists. The Dow Jones index has lost about 10% from its record closing high on 19 May, mean it is entering a correction – a fall of at least 10% from a recent peak. The Dow has not fallen into correction territory since October 2011. Friday’s fall takes the Dow to its sharpest weekly decline in four years. Stocks had already fallen sharply in Europe, Asia and Australia. In London, the FTSE 100 closed down 180 points, or 2.8%, to 6,187 – the lowest it has been this year and the biggest one-day fall since October 2014. The UK index closed down for nine straight sessions – its longest losing streak since 2011. The FTSE 100 has fallen by 5.6% this week, which equates to around
