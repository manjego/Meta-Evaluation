<t> This is the third part of our major Good Health series on dementia . </t> <t> We look at ways to help minimise the impact of memory problems . </t> <t> For example , we need just as much sleep as we get older . </t> <t> The problem is that older people find it harder to reach a deeper sleep . </t> <t> When the short - term memory starts to go , it can make it hard for someone to recall what they have already done that day , such as whether they ' ve had breakfast , or showered , or spoken to someone . </t> <t> It can help to keep a diary - a record of what has been done through the day . </t> <t> Writing also helps encourage the cognitive processes , which can help slow down future decline . </t> <t> Create a memory hub - that is , a central place in the home , perhaps the dining room table or a desk , where important notes , car keys , house keys and drugs that need to be taken are kept . </t> <t> Put things here that you want to be able to find quickly . </t> <t> Get into the habit of having everything in this one place rather than having things scattered about the home . </t> <t> Get a whiteboard or blackboard - that can be used to record a timetable of what needs to be done each day that week . </t> <t> Things that get done can be ticked off . </t> <t> It is another way to show what has been done , but also shows what remains to be done . </t> <t> Label doors , drawers , cupboards and cabinets to avoid confusion about what goes where . </t> <t> Have a list of the numbers of key people by the phone - your GP and other care professionals , carers , family and reliable friends . </t> <t> Have a daily newspaper delivered - it is a simple way of keeping aware of what is happening in the world and is a useful reminder of that day 's date . </t> <t> When showering or having a bath , establish a routine as a reminder of whether your hair has been washed . </t> <t> For example , move the conditioner and shampoo from one side of the bath to the other once you ' ve used them . </t> <t> Eat regular meals . </t> <t> While other body cells can take fuel from elsewhere , the brain relies on a good supply of glucose from the blood . </t> <t> That 's why skipping a meal can affect reasoning , cognition and memory . </t> <t> In the early stages of dementia , begin a reminiscence book to act as a reminder of key events in that person 's life and who people are . </t> <t> It 's a nice thing for the person with dementia and a loved one to do together . </t> <t> Include pictures and snippets of information and date and label every entry . </t>

' </t> <t> Finishing sentences for them can increase frustration . </t> <t> It 's better to ask if they 'd like you to find words for them if they 're having difficulty . </t> <t> Watch their body language as this can give you clues about how they are feeling . </t> <t> For example , repetitive movements can mean they are anxious or scared , while withdrawing may mean they feel overwhelmed . </t> <t> If they 're doing something obviously wrong , for example putting dishes in the washing machine or clothes in a food cupboard , do n't ask them why or castigate them - the reasoning side of their brain has been affected and pointing out their mistakes will only cause them embarrassment and frustration . </t>
